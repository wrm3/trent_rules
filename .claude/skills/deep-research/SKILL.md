# Deep Research Skill - Claude-Native Autonomous Research

**THIS IS AN AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH METHODOLOGY FOR CLAUDE**

You (Claude) conduct comprehensive, multi-phase research using your built-in tools (WebSearch, WebFetch). No external APIs, no Python scripts, no dependencies - just your own reasoning and research capabilities.

## Core Concept

When a user needs comprehensive research:
1. **You conduct the research** using WebSearch and WebFetch
2. **You analyze and synthesize** using your reasoning
3. **You write professional reports** using Write tool
4. **You cite sources properly** with verification

**This is NOT manual research guidance. This IS your autonomous research workflow.**

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when user requests:
- "Research X comprehensively"
- "Deep dive into Y"
- "Compare multiple options for Z"
- "I need a detailed analysis of..."
- "Investigate A thoroughly"
- "Literature review on B"

**Trigger phrases**: research, investigate, analyze, deep dive, comprehensive, comparison, literature review

## Research Modes

### Quick Research (5-10 sources, ~10 minutes)
**Use when**: User needs quick overview or has time constraints
**Process**: 2-3 WebSearch queries, 5-8 WebFetch calls, basic synthesis

### Standard Research (10-15 sources, ~20 minutes)
**Use when**: Most research requests (DEFAULT)
**Process**: 4-5 WebSearch queries, 10-12 WebFetch calls, detailed synthesis

### Comprehensive Research (20-30 sources, ~40 minutes)
**Use when**: User explicitly requests "comprehensive", "thorough", "detailed"
**Process**: 6-8 WebSearch queries, 20-25 WebFetch calls, exhaustive synthesis

### Iterative Research (30+ sources, ~60 minutes)
**Use when**: User requests "exhaustive", "complete guide", "everything about X"
**Process**: Multi-phase research with section-based deep dives

## Phase 1: Research Planning

### Step 1: Understand the Request
Clarify:
- **What exactly** needs to be researched?
- **How deep** should the research be? (mode selection)
- **What output** does the user expect?
- **Any specific focus** areas or constraints?

**Ask clarifying questions if needed**, but don't over-clarify obvious requests.

### Step 2: Break Down the Topic
Identify research dimensions:
- **Core concepts**: What are the fundamental aspects?
- **Key questions**: What specific questions need answering?
- **Comparison factors**: If comparing options, what criteria matter?
- **Information sources**: What types of sources are most valuable?

### Step 3: Plan Search Strategy
Create search query variations:
- **Broad queries**: "X overview", "what is X"
- **Specific queries**: "X best practices", "X vs Y", "X tutorial"
- **Current queries**: "X 2025", "X latest", "X recent updates"
- **Authoritative queries**: "X official documentation", "X specification"
- **Problem-focused**: "X challenges", "X pitfalls", "X comparison"

**Example for "React state management"**:
- "React state management overview"
- "React state management best practices 2025"
- "Redux vs MobX vs Zustand comparison"
- "React state management official documentation"
- "React state management patterns"

## Phase 2: Information Gathering

### Step 1: Execute Multi-Search Strategy

**DO THIS** (parallel searches for efficiency):
```
Use WebSearch tool multiple times in PARALLEL with different queries:
- Query 1: Broad overview
- Query 2: Best practices/recent
- Query 3: Comparison/alternatives
- Query 4: Official documentation
- Query 5: Specific aspect (if needed)
```

**From each search**:
- Note promising URLs (official docs, reputable sites, recent articles)
- Identify key themes appearing across results
- Skip obviously low-quality sources

### Step 2: Fetch Detailed Content

**Prioritize sources** in this order:
1. **Official documentation** (.org, official project sites)
2. **Reputable technical sites** (MDN, CSS-Tricks, Smashing Magazine, web.dev)
3. **Well-known blogs** (Vercel, Netlify, major tech companies)
4. **Recent articles** (2024-2025)
5. **Community resources** (GitHub discussions, Stack Overflow)

**Use WebFetch in PARALLEL** for top 10-25 sources (based on mode):
```
Fetch multiple URLs simultaneously:
- Official docs (highest priority)
- 3-5 reputable technical articles
- 2-3 comparison/analysis pieces
- 2-3 recent articles (currency)
- 1-2 community discussions (real-world perspective)
```

**Extract from each fetch**:
- Key points and insights
- Quotes worth citing
- Code examples (if relevant)
- Author/publication date
- URL for citation

### Step 3: Assess Source Quality

For each source, note:
- **Authority**: Official docs > Expert blogs > Community content
- **Currency**: Recent (2024-2025) > Older content
- **Depth**: Detailed analysis > Surface-level overviews
- **Objectivity**: Balanced perspective > Promotional content

**Trust indicators**:
- .gov, .edu, .org domains
- Official project documentation
- Recognized expert authors
- Recent publication dates
- Multiple corroborating sources

## Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis

### Step 1: Organize Findings

Group information by themes:
- **Core concepts**: Fundamental understanding
- **Approaches/Options**: Different ways to solve the problem
- **Best practices**: Recommended patterns
- **Common pitfalls**: What to avoid
- **Real-world usage**: How it's used in practice
- **Tradeoffs**: Pros and cons of different approaches

### Step 2: Identify Patterns

Look for:
- **Consensus**: What do multiple sources agree on?
- **Disagreements**: Where do sources conflict?
- **Evolution**: How has thinking changed over time?
- **Trends**: What's emerging or declining?
- **Gaps**: What information is missing?

### Step 3: Synthesize Insights

**Your job** (Claude's unique value):
- **Connect dots**: Link concepts across sources
- **Provide context**: Explain why things matter
- **Identify trade-offs**: Weigh pros and cons
- **Give perspective**: What's most important?
- **Make recommendations**: Based on synthesis

**Don't just summarize** - add value through:
- Cross-source analysis
- Pattern identification
- Contextual understanding
- Nuanced recommendations

## Phase 4: Report Generation

## Efficiency Tips

### Use Parallel Tool Calls
**DO THIS**:
```
Send one message with multiple WebSearch calls
Send one message with multiple WebFetch calls
```

**DON'T DO THIS**:
```
WebSearch, wait for results
WebSearch again, wait for results
WebSearch again, wait for results
(Sequential = slow!)
```

### Prioritize Ruthlessly
Focus on:
- Official documentation first
- Most reputable sources
- Recent content
- Directly relevant material

Skip:
- Obviously low-quality content
- Outdated information
- Promotional material
- Tangentially related topics

### Know When to Stop
Research has diminishing returns:
- **Quick**: 5-10 sources is enough
- **Standard**: 10-15 sources
- **Comprehensive**: 20-25 sources
- **Iterative**: 30-50 sources

**More sources ≠ better research**. Quality over quantity.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Just Summarize Sources
**Wrong**: "Source 1 says X. Source 2 says Y. Source 3 says Z."
**Right**: "Multiple sources agree that X is best for Y use case, though Z has advantages for specific scenarios [1][2][3]. The key trade-off is..."

### ❌ Don't: Single Source Dependency
**Wrong**: Base conclusions on one source
**Right**: Verify important claims across 3+ sources

### ❌ Don't: Ignore Currency
**Wrong**: Use 2019 article about 2025 technology
**Right**: Prioritize 2024-2025 content, note when using older sources

### ❌ Don't: Skip Synthesis
**Wrong**: List findings without analysis
**Right**: Connect findings, identify patterns, provide insights

### ❌ Don't: Forget Citations
**Wrong**: Make claims without sources
**Right**: Cite everything [1]

### ❌ Don't: Over-Research Trivial Questions
**Wrong**: 30 sources for "What is React?"
**Right**: 5 sources for simple questions
