# Computer Use Agent - Safety Guidelines

## Overview

The Computer Use Agent Skill provides powerful desktop automation capabilities, but with that power comes responsibility. This document provides comprehensive safety guidelines for using this skill safely and responsibly.

## Core Safety Principles

### 1. FAILSAFE is Mandatory
**The FAILSAFE feature MUST always be enabled.**

- **What it does**: Immediately aborts automation when mouse moves to upper-left corner
- **How to use**: Simply move mouse to the very top-left corner of your screen
- **When to use**: Anytime automation is doing something unexpected or dangerous
- **Configuration**: Always verify FAILSAFE is enabled before starting automation

**Never disable FAILSAFE** unless you have a specific, well-understood reason.

### 2. Start Simple, Build Confidence
**Always test with simple, low-risk tasks first.**

**Progression:**
1. **Day 1**: Single-click actions in test applications
2. **Day 2**: Multi-step workflows in test applications
3. **Day 3**: Simple production tasks with monitoring
4. **Week 2+**: Complex production workflows

**Never jump straight to complex or critical tasks.**

### 3. Monitor First Runs Closely
**Watch all automation closely, especially first runs.**

- Keep your eyes on the screen
- Have hand ready to trigger FAILSAFE
- Use confirmation mode for first run of each workflow
- Don't leave computer unattended during automation
- Review screenshot logs after completion

### 4. Use Appropriate Safety Settings
**Configure safety settings based on task risk and complexity.**

**Low Risk Tasks** (viewing, reading, navigation):
```yaml
failsafe_enabled: true
action_delay: 0.5
max_steps: 20
confirmation_mode: false
screenshot_logging: true
```

**Medium Risk Tasks** (form filling, data entry):
```yaml
failsafe_enabled: true
action_delay: 1.0
max_steps: 50
confirmation_mode: true  # First run only
screenshot_logging: true
```

**High Risk Tasks** (file operations, configuration changes):
```yaml
failsafe_enabled: true
action_delay: 2.0
max_steps: 30
confirmation_mode: true  # Always
screenshot_logging: true
```

### 5. Never Automate Sensitive Operations
**Some operations should NEVER be automated.**

**Absolutely Prohibited:**
- ❌ Password entry
- ❌ Banking or financial transactions
- ❌ Credit card information
- ❌ Social security numbers
- ❌ Personal health information
- ❌ Authentication codes (2FA, OTP)

**Require Explicit Permission:**
- ⚠️ File deletion
- ⚠️ Data modification
- ⚠️ Email sending
- ⚠️ Social media posting
- ⚠️ System configuration changes
- ⚠️ Software installation

## Safety Features

### FAILSAFE Mode

**How It Works:**
1. PyAutoGUI monitors mouse position constantly
2. If mouse reaches screen corners (configurable), automation STOPS immediately
3. All pending actions are cancelled
4. Control returns to user

**Default FAILSAFE Locations:**
- Upper-left corner (0, 0)
- Can be configured to other corners if needed

**Using FAILSAFE:**
1. Keep mouse away from corners during setup
2. Move mouse to corner quickly if automation goes wrong
3. Automation stops within milliseconds
4. No confirmation required - instant stop

**Testing FAILSAFE:**
Before first use, test that FAILSAFE works:
1. Start simple automation
2. Move mouse to upper-left corner
3. Verify automation stops immediately
4. Confirm you can regain control

### Action Delays

**Purpose:** Give applications time to respond between actions

**Recommended Delays:**
- **0.3s**: Very fast UIs (games, real-time apps)
- **0.5s**: Standard UIs (most applications)
- **1.0s**: Complex UIs (multi-step animations)
- **2.0s**: Slow UIs (heavy applications, network calls)
- **5.0s+**: Very slow UIs (startup, large data loads)

**When to Increase Delay:**
- Actions missing targets
- UI not ready for next action
- Animations not completing
- Network requests pending
- Application under heavy load

### Step Limits

**Purpose:** Prevent infinite loops and runaway automation

**Recommended Limits:**
- **10-20 steps**: Simple tasks (form filling, menu navigation)
- **20-50 steps**: Medium tasks (multi-form workflows)
- **50-100 steps**: Complex tasks (multi-application workflows)

**What Happens at Limit:**
- Automation stops automatically
- Current state saved
- Screenshot captured
- User notified
- Option to continue with higher limit

**Setting Step Limits:**
- Estimate task complexity
- Add 50% buffer for unexpected steps
- Start conservative, increase if needed
- Monitor actual steps used
- Adjust for future runs

### Confirmation Mode

**Purpose:** Require user approval before executing actions

**Levels:**
1. **No Confirmation**: Automation runs fully automatically
2. **First Action**: Confirm before starting, then run
3. **Critical Actions**: Confirm destructive actions only
4. **Every Action**: Confirm each action (debugging/learning)

**When to Use:**
- ✅ First run of new workflow
- ✅ High-risk operations
- ✅ Production environments
- ✅ Learning/debugging
- ❌ Tested, low-risk workflows
- ❌ Batch operations (too many confirmations)

### Screenshot Logging

**Purpose:** Create audit trail of automation activities

**What Gets Logged:**
- Screenshot before each action
- Screenshot after each action
- Screenshot of errors or unexpected states
- Screenshot at task completion
- Metadata (timestamp, action type, coordinates)

**Storage:**
- Default: `~/.cursor/computer-use-logs/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- Organized by task run
- Includes metadata JSON
- Automatically cleaned up after 30 days (configurable)

**Using Logs:**
- Review what automation did
- Debug failed workflows
- Verify correct operation
- Compliance/audit requirements
- Training data for improvements
