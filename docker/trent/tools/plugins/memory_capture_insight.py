"""
memory_capture_insight — Tier 2 (active): explicit structured insight capture.

Call this tool when you learn something worth remembering across sessions:
  - A user preference (code style, naming conventions, formatting)
  - A procedure you should follow (how to deploy, test pattern, git flow)
  - A correction (something you did wrong, should avoid in future)
  - An architectural decision and its rationale
  - Project context that took effort to establish

Inspired by letta-code's structured memory categories.

    "Capture a specific insight, preference, procedure, or decision for long-term memory. "
    "Call this when you learn something worth preserving across sessions: user preferences, "
    "how-to procedures, corrections to avoid, architectural decisions. "
    "Each insight is stored under a topic tag and updated if that topic already has a capture — "
    "so the memory stays current rather than accumulating duplicates. "
    "BEST PRACTICE: Call at session end after memory_capture_session, or mid-session when you "
    "learn something important."
