Build with Claude

Features overview

Copy page

Claude's API surface is organized into five areas:

- **Model capabilities:** Control how Claude reasons and formats responses.
- **Tools:** Let Claude take actions on the web or in your environment.
- **Tool infrastructure:** Handles discovery and orchestration at scale.
- **Context management:** Keeps long-running sessions efficient.
- **Files and assets:** Manage the documents and data you provide to Claude.

If you're new, start with [model capabilities](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/overview#model-capabilities) and [tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/overview#tools). Return to the other sections when you're ready to optimize cost, latency, or scale.
