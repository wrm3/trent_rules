### February 19, 2026

- We've launched **automatic caching** for the Messages API. Add a single `cache_control` field to your request body and the system automatically caches the last cacheable block, moving the cache point forward as conversations grow. No manual breakpoint management required. Works alongside existing block-level cache control for fine-grained optimization. Available on the Claude API and Azure AI Foundry (preview). Learn more in our [prompt caching documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#automatic-caching).
- We've retired the Claude Sonnet 3.7 model (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`) and the Claude Haiku 3.5 model (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`). All requests to these models will now return an error. We recommend upgrading to [Claude Sonnet 4.6](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview#latest-models-comparison) and [Claude Haiku 4.5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview#latest-models-comparison) respectively. Researchers can request ongoing access through the [External Researcher Access Program](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9125743-what-is-the-external-researcher-access-program).
- We announced the deprecation of the Claude Haiku 3 model (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`), with retirement scheduled for April 19, 2026. We recommend migrating to [Claude Haiku 4.5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview#latest-models-comparison).

- We've released updated versions of our tools that decouple the text edit and bash tools from the computer use system prompt:
  - `bash_20250124`: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.
  - `text_editor_20250124`: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.
  - `computer_20250124`: Updated computer use tool with new command options including "hold\_key", "left\_mouse\_down", "left\_mouse\_up", "scroll", "triple\_click", and "wait". This tool requires the "computer-use-2025-01-24" anthropic-beta header.
