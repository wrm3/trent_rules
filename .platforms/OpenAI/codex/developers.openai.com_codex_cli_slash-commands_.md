Slash commands give you fast, keyboard-first control over Codex. Type `/` in
the composer to open the slash popup, choose a command, and Codex will perform
actions such as switching models, adjusting permissions, or summarizing long
conversations without leaving the terminal.

This guide shows you how to:

- Find the right built-in slash command for a task
- Steer an active session with commands like `/model`, `/personality`,
`/permissions`, `/experimental`, `/agent`, and `/status`

## Built-in slash commands

Codex ships with the following commands. Open the slash popup and start typing
the command name to filter the list.

| Command | Purpose | When to use it |

| [`/new`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands/#start-a-new-conversation-with-new) | Start a new conversation inside the same CLI session. | Reset the chat context without leaving the CLI when you want a fresh prompt in the same repo. |
| [`/quit`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands/#exit-the-cli-with-quit-or-exit) | Exit the CLI. | Leave the session immediately. |
| [`/review`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands/#ask-for-a-working-tree-review-with-review) | Ask Codex to review your working tree. | Run after Codex completes work or when you want a second set of eyes on local changes. |
| [`/status`](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands/#inspect-the-session-with-status) | Display session configuration and token usage. | Confirm the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and remaining context capacity. |

`/quit` and `/exit` both exit the CLI. Use them only after you have saved or
committed any important work.

The `/approvals` command still works as an alias, but it no longer appears in the slash popup list.

## Control your session with slash commands

The following workflows keep your session on track without restarting Codex.

### Set the active model with `/model`

1. Start Codex and open the composer.
2. Type `/model` and press Enter.
3. Choose a model such as `gpt-4.1-mini` or `gpt-4.1` from the popup.

Expected: Codex confirms the new model in the transcript. Run `/status` to verify the change.

### Set a communication style with `/personality`

Use `/personality` to change how Codex communicates without rewriting your prompt.

1. In an active conversation, type `/personality` and press Enter.
2. Choose a style from the popup.

Expected: Codex confirms the new style in the transcript and uses it for later
responses in the thread.

Codex supports `friendly`, `pragmatic`, and `none` personalities. Use `none`
to disable personality instructions.

If the active model doesn’t support personality-specific instructions, Codex hides this command.

### Switch to plan mode with `/plan`

1. Type `/plan` and press Enter to switch the active conversation into plan
mode.
2. Optional: provide inline prompt text (for example, `/plan Propose a migration plan for this service`).
3. You can paste content or attach images while using inline `/plan` arguments.

Expected: Codex enters plan mode and uses your optional inline prompt as the first planning request.

While a task is already running, `/plan` is temporarily unavailable.

### Toggle experimental features with `/experimental`

1. Type `/experimental` and press Enter.
2. Toggle the features you want (for example, **Multi-agents**), then restart Codex.

Expected: Codex saves your feature choices to config and applies them on restart.

### Clear the terminal and start a new chat with `/clear`

1. Type `/clear` and press Enter.

Expected: Codex clears the terminal, resets the visible transcript, and starts
a fresh chat in the same CLI session.

Unlike `Ctrl` + `L`, `/clear` starts a new conversation.

`Ctrl` + `L` only clears the terminal view and keeps the current
chat. Codex disables both actions while a task is in progress.

### Update permissions with `/permissions`

1. Type `/permissions` and press Enter.
2. Select the approval preset that matches your comfort level, for example
`Auto` for hands-off runs or `Read Only` to review edits.

Expected: Codex announces the updated policy. Future actions respect the
updated approval mode until you change it again.

### Copy the latest response with `/copy`

1. Type `/copy` and press Enter.

Expected: Codex copies the latest completed Codex output to your clipboard.

If a turn is still running, `/copy` uses the latest completed output instead of
the in-progress response. The command is unavailable before the first completed
Codex output and immediately after a rollback.

### Grant sandbox read access with `/sandbox-add-read-dir`

This command is available only when running the CLI natively on Windows.

1. Type `/sandbox-add-read-dir C:\absolute\directory\path` and press Enter.
2. Confirm the path is an existing absolute directory.

Expected: Codex refreshes the Windows sandbox policy and grants read access to
that directory for later commands that run in the sandbox.

### Inspect the session with `/status`

1. In any conversation, type `/status`.
2. Review the output for the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and current token usage.

Expected: You see a summary like what `codex status` prints in the shell,
confirming Codex is operating where you expect.

### Inspect config layers with `/debug-config`

1. Type `/debug-config`.
2. Review the output for config layer order (lowest precedence first), on/off
state, and policy sources.

Expected: Codex prints layer diagnostics plus policy details such as
`allowed_approval_policies`, `allowed_sandbox_modes`, `mcp_servers`, `rules`,
`enforce_residency`, and `experimental_network` when configured.

Use this output to debug why an effective setting differs from `config.toml`.

### Configure footer items with `/statusline`

1. Type `/statusline`.
2. Use the picker to toggle and reorder items, then confirm.

Expected: The footer status line updates immediately and persists to
`tui.status_line` in `config.toml`.

Available status-line items include model, model+reasoning, context stats, rate
limits, git branch, token counters, session id, current directory/project root,
and Codex version.

### Check background terminals with `/ps`

1. Type `/ps`.
2. Review the list of background terminals and their status.

Expected: Codex shows each background terminal’s command plus up to three
recent, non-empty output lines so you can gauge progress at a glance.

Background terminals appear when `unified_exec` is in use; otherwise, the list may be empty.

### Keep transcripts lean with `/compact`

1. After a long exchange, type `/compact`.
2. Confirm when Codex offers to summarize the conversation so far.

Expected: Codex replaces earlier turns with a concise summary, freeing context
while keeping critical details.

### Review changes with `/diff`

1. Type `/diff` to inspect the Git diff.
2. Scroll through the output inside the CLI to review edits and added files.

Expected: Codex shows changes you’ve staged, changes you haven’t staged yet,
and files Git hasn’t started tracking, so you can decide what to keep.

### Highlight files with `/mention`

1. Type `/mention` followed by a path, for example `/mention src/lib/api.ts`.
2. Select the matching result from the popup.

Expected: Codex adds the file to the conversation, ensuring follow-up turns reference it directly.

### Start a new conversation with `/new`

1. Type `/new` and press Enter.

Expected: Codex starts a fresh conversation in the same CLI session, so you
can switch tasks without leaving your terminal.

Unlike `/clear`, `/new` does not clear the current terminal view first.

### Resume a saved conversation with `/resume`

1. Type `/resume` and press Enter.
2. Choose the session you want from the saved-session picker.

Expected: Codex reloads the selected conversation’s transcript so you can pick
up where you left off, keeping the original history intact.

### Fork the current conversation with `/fork`

1. Type `/fork` and press Enter.

Expected: Codex clones the current conversation into a new thread with a fresh
ID, leaving the original transcript untouched so you can explore an alternative
approach in parallel.

If you need to fork a saved session instead of the current one, run
`codex fork` in your terminal to open the session picker.

### Generate `AGENTS.md` with `/init`

1. Run `/init` in the directory where you want Codex to look for persistent instructions.
2. Review the generated `AGENTS.md`, then edit it to match your repository conventions.

Expected: Codex creates an `AGENTS.md` scaffold you can refine and commit for
future sessions.

### Ask for a working tree review with `/review`

1. Type `/review`.
2. Follow up with `/diff` if you want to inspect the exact file changes.

Expected: Codex summarizes issues it finds in your working tree, focusing on
behavior changes and missing tests. It uses the current session model unless
you set `review_model` in `config.toml`.

### List MCP tools with `/mcp`

1. Type `/mcp`.
2. Review the list to confirm which MCP servers and tools are available.

Expected: You see the configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools Codex can call in this session.

### Browse apps with `/apps`

1. Type `/apps`.
2. Pick an app from the list.

Expected: Codex inserts the app mention into the composer as `$app-slug`, so
you can immediately ask Codex to use it.

### Switch agent threads with `/agent`

1. Type `/agent` and press Enter.
2. Select the thread you want from the picker.

Expected: Codex switches the active thread so you can inspect or continue that
agent’s work.

### Send feedback with `/feedback`

1. Type `/feedback` and press Enter.
2. Follow the prompts to include logs or diagnostics.

Expected: Codex collects the requested diagnostics and submits them to the
maintainers.

### Sign out with `/logout`

1. Type `/logout` and press Enter.

Expected: Codex clears local credentials for the current user session.

### Exit the CLI with `/quit` or `/exit`

1. Type `/quit` (or `/exit`) and press Enter.

Expected: Codex exits immediately. Save or commit any important work first.
