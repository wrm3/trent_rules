Administration and monitoring

Admin API overview

Copy page

**The Admin API is unavailable for individual accounts.** To collaborate with teammates and add members, set up your organization in **Console → Settings → Organization**.

The [Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin) allows you to programmatically manage your organization's resources, including organization members, workspaces, and API keys. This provides programmatic control over administrative tasks that would otherwise require manual configuration in the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/).

**The Admin API requires special access**

The Admin API requires a special Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin...`) that differs from standard API keys. Only organization members with the admin role can provision Admin API keys through the Claude Console.

## How the Admin API works

When you use the Admin API:

1. You make requests using your Admin API key in the `x-api-key` header
2. The API allows you to manage:
   - Organization members and their roles
   - Organization member invites
   - Workspaces and their members
   - API keys

This is useful for:

- Automating user onboarding/offboarding
- Programmatically managing workspace access
- Monitoring and managing API key usage

## Organization roles and permissions

There are five organization-level roles. See more details in the [API Console roles and permissions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10186004-api-console-roles-and-permissions) article.

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| user | Can use Workbench |
| claude\_code\_user | Can use Workbench and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) |
| developer | Can use Workbench and manage API keys |
| billing | Can use Workbench and manage billing details |
| admin | Can do all of the above, plus manage users |

## Key concepts

### Organization Members

You can list [organization members](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/users/get-user), update member roles, and remove members.

Shell

```
# List organization members
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/users?limit=10" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Update member role
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/users/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"role": "developer"}'

# Remove member
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/users/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

### Organization Invites

You can invite users to organizations and manage those [invites](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/invites/get-invite).

Shell

```
# Create invite
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/invites" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "email": "newuser@domain.com",
    "role": "developer"
  }'

# List invites
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/invites?limit=10" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Delete invite
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/invites/{invite_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

### Workspaces

For a comprehensive guide to workspaces, including Console and API examples, see [Workspaces](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/workspaces).

### Workspace Members

Manage [user access to specific workspaces](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspace_members/get-workspace-member):

Shell

```
# Add member to workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "user_xxx",
    "workspace_role": "workspace_developer"
  }'

# List workspace members
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members?limit=10" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Update member role
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "workspace_role": "workspace_admin"
  }'

# Remove member from workspace
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

### API Keys

Monitor and manage [API keys](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/apikeys/get-api-key):

Shell

```
# List API keys
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/api_keys?limit=10&status=active&workspace_id=wrkspc_xxx" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Update API key
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/api_keys/{api_key_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "status": "inactive",
    "name": "New Key Name"
  }'
```

## Accessing organization info

Get information about your organization programmatically with the `/v1/organizations/me` endpoint.

For example:

```
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/me" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

```
{
  "id": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678",
  "type": "organization",
  "name": "Organization Name"
}
```

This endpoint is useful for programmatically determining which organization an Admin API key belongs to.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see the [Organization Info API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/organization/get-me).

## Usage and cost reports

Track your organization's usage and costs with the [Usage and Cost API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api).

## Claude Code analytics

Monitor developer productivity and Claude Code adoption with the [Claude Code Analytics API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-code-analytics-api).

## Best practices

To effectively use the Admin API:

- Use meaningful names and descriptions for workspaces and API keys
- Implement proper error handling for failed operations
- Regularly audit member roles and permissions
- Clean up unused workspaces and expired invites
- Monitor API key usage and rotate keys periodically
