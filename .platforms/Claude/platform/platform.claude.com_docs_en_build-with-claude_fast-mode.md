Model capabilities

Fast mode (research preview)

Copy page

Fast mode provides significantly faster output token generation for Claude Opus 4.6. By setting `speed: "fast"` in your API request, you get up to 2.5x higher output tokens per second from the same model at premium pricing.

Fast mode is in research preview. [Join the waitlist](https://claude.com/fast-mode) to request access. Availability is limited while Anthropic gathers feedback.

This feature is eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/zero-data-retention). When your organization has a ZDR arrangement, data sent through this feature is not stored after the API response is returned.

## Supported models

Fast mode is supported on the following models:

- Claude Opus 4.6 (`claude-opus-4-6`)

## How fast mode works

Fast mode runs the same model with a faster inference configuration. There is no change to intelligence or capabilities.

- Up to 2.5x higher output tokens per second compared to standard speed
- Speed benefits are focused on output tokens per second (OTPS), not time to first token (TTFT)
- Same model weights and behavior (not a different model)

## Basic usage

Shell

```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
    --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    --header "anthropic-beta: fast-mode-2026-02-01" \
    --header "content-type: application/json" \
    --data '{
        "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
        "max_tokens": 4096,
        "speed": "fast",
        "messages": [{\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Refactor this module to use dependency injection"\
        }]
    }'
```

## Pricing

Fast mode is priced at 6x standard Opus rates across the full context window. The following table shows pricing for Claude Opus 4.6 with fast mode:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| $30 / MTok | $150 / MTok |

Fast mode pricing stacks with other pricing modifiers:

- [Prompt caching multipliers](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#model-pricing) apply on top of fast mode pricing
- [Data residency](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/data-residency) multipliers apply on top of fast mode pricing

For complete pricing details, see the [pricing page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#fast-mode-pricing).

## Rate limits

Fast mode has a dedicated rate limit that is separate from standard Opus rate limits. Unlike standard speed, which has separate limits for ≤200K and >200K input tokens, fast mode uses a single rate limit that covers the full context range. When your fast mode rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a `429` error with a `retry-after` header indicating when capacity will be available.

The response includes headers that indicate your fast mode rate limit status:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `anthropic-fast-input-tokens-limit` | Maximum fast mode input tokens per minute |
| `anthropic-fast-input-tokens-remaining` | Remaining fast mode input tokens |
| `anthropic-fast-input-tokens-reset` | Time when the fast mode input token limit resets |
| `anthropic-fast-output-tokens-limit` | Maximum fast mode output tokens per minute |
| `anthropic-fast-output-tokens-remaining` | Remaining fast mode output tokens |
| `anthropic-fast-output-tokens-reset` | Time when the fast mode output token limit resets |

For tier-specific rate limits, see the [rate limits page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/rate-limits).

## Checking which speed was used

The response `usage` object includes a `speed` field that indicates which speed was used, either `"fast"` or `"standard"`:

Shell

```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
    --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
    --header "anthropic-beta: fast-mode-2026-02-01" \
    --header "content-type: application/json" \
    --data '{
        "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
        "max_tokens": 1024,
        "speed": "fast",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
    }'
```

JSON

```
{
  "id": "msg_01XFDUDYJgAACzvnptvVoYEL",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  ...
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 523,
    "output_tokens": 1842,
    "speed": "fast"
  }
}
```

## Retries and fallback

### Automatic retries

When fast mode rate limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429` error with a `retry-after` header. The Anthropic SDKs automatically retry these requests up to 2 times by default (configurable via `max_retries`), waiting for the server-specified delay before each retry. Since fast mode uses continuous token replenishment, the `retry-after` delay is typically short and requests succeed once capacity is available.

### Falling back to standard speed

If you'd prefer to fall back to standard speed rather than wait for fast mode capacity, catch the rate limit error and retry without `speed: "fast"`. Set `max_retries` to `0` on the initial fast request to skip automatic retries and fail immediately on rate limit errors.

Falling back from fast to standard speed will result in a [prompt cache](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) miss. Requests at different speeds do not share cached prefixes.

Since setting `max_retries` to `0` also disables retries for other transient errors (overloaded, internal server errors), the examples below re-issue the original request with default retries for those cases.

Python

```

def create_message_with_fast_fallback(max_retries=None, max_attempts=3, **params):
    try:
        return client.beta.messages.create(**params, max_retries=max_retries)
    except anthropic.RateLimitError:
        if params.get("speed") == "fast":
            del params["speed"]
            return create_message_with_fast_fallback(**params)
        raise
    except (
        anthropic.InternalServerError,
        anthropic.OverloadedError,
        anthropic.APIConnectionError,
    ):
        if max_attempts > 1:
            return create_message_with_fast_fallback(
                max_attempts=max_attempts - 1, **params
            )
        raise

message = create_message_with_fast_fallback(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    betas=["fast-mode-2026-02-01"],
    speed="fast",
    max_retries=0,
)
```

## Considerations

- **Prompt caching:** Switching between fast and standard speed invalidates the prompt cache. Requests at different speeds do not share cached prefixes.
- **Supported models:** Fast mode is currently supported on Opus 4.6 only. Sending `speed: "fast"` with an unsupported model returns an error.
- **TTFT:** Fast mode's benefits are focused on output tokens per second (OTPS), not time to first token (TTFT).
- **Batch API:** Fast mode is not available with the [Batch API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing).
- **Priority Tier:** Fast mode is not available with [Priority Tier](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/service-tiers).
