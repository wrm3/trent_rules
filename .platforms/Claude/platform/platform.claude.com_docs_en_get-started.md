Set your API key







Get your API key from the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys) and set it as an environment variable:









```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

2. 2



Make your first API call







Run this command to create a simple web search assistant:









```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     -d '{
       "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
       "max_tokens": 1000,
       "messages": [\
         {\
           "role": "user",\
           "content": "What should I search for to find the latest developments in renewable energy?"\
         }\
       ]
     }'
```























**Example output:**









```
{
     "id": "msg_01HCDu5LRGeP2o7s2xGmxyx8",
     "type": "message",
     "role": "assistant",
     "content": [\
       {\
         "type": "text",\
         "text": "Here are some effective search strategies to find the latest renewable energy developments:\n\n## Search Terms to Use:\n- \"renewable energy news 2024\"\n- \"clean energy breakthrough\"\n- \"solar/wind/battery technology advances\"\n- \"green energy innovations\"\n- \"climate tech developments\"\n- \"energy storage solutions\"\n\n## Best Sources to Check:\n\n**News & Industry Sites:**\n- Renewable Energy World\n- GreenTech Media (now Wood Mackenzie)\n- Energy Storage News\n- CleanTechnica\n- PV Magazine (for solar)\n- WindPower Engineering & Development..."\
       }\
     ],
     "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
     "stop_reason": "end_turn",
     "usage": {
       "input_tokens": 21,
       "output_tokens": 305
     }
}
```
