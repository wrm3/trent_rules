Claude on 3rd-party platforms

Vertex AI

Copy page

The Vertex API for accessing Claude is nearly-identical to the [Messages API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages) and supports all of the same options, with two key differences:

- In Vertex, `model` is not passed in the request body. Instead, it is specified in the Google Cloud endpoint URL.
- In Vertex, `anthropic_version` is passed in the request body (rather than as a header), and must be set to the value `vertex-2023-10-16`.

Vertex is also supported by Anthropic's official [client SDKs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/client-sdks). This guide walks you through making a request to Claude on Vertex AI using one of Anthropic's client SDKs.

Note that this guide assumes you already have a GCP project that is able to use Vertex AI. See [using the Claude 3 models from Anthropic](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude) for more information on the setup required, as well as a full walkthrough.

## Install an SDK for accessing Vertex AI

First, install Anthropic's [client SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/client-sdks) for your language of choice.

## Accessing Vertex AI

### Model availability

Note that Anthropic model availability varies by region. Search for "Claude" in the [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden) or go to [Use Claude 3](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude) for the latest information.

### Making requests

Before running requests you may need to run `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate with GCP.

The following examples show how to generate text from Claude on Vertex AI:

Shell

```
MODEL_ID=claude-opus-4-6
LOCATION=global
PROJECT_ID=MY_PROJECT_ID

curl \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://$LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION}/publishers/anthropic/models/${MODEL_ID}:streamRawPredict -d \
'{
  "anthropic_version": "vertex-2023-10-16",
  "messages": [{\
    "role": "user",\
    "content": "Hey Claude!"\
  }],
  "max_tokens": 100,
}'
```

See the [client SDKs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/client-sdks) and the official [Vertex AI docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs) for more details.

Claude is also available through [Amazon Bedrock](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-amazon-bedrock) and [Microsoft Foundry](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry).

## Activity logging

Vertex provides a [request-response logging service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/request-response-logging) that allows customers to log the prompts and completions associated with your usage.

Anthropic recommends that you log your activity on at least a 30-day rolling basis in order to understand your activity and investigate any potential misuse.

Turning on this service does not give Google or Anthropic any access to your content.

## Feature support

For all currently supported features on Vertex AI, see [API features overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/overview).

## Global vs regional endpoints

Starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all future models**, Google Vertex AI offers two endpoint types:

- **Global endpoints:** Dynamic routing for maximum availability
- **Regional endpoints:** Guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions

Regional endpoints include a 10% pricing premium over global endpoints.

This applies to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and future models only. Older models (Claude Sonnet 4, Opus 4, and earlier) maintain their existing pricing structures.

### When to use each option

**Global endpoints (recommended):**

- Provide maximum availability and uptime
- Dynamically route requests to regions with available capacity
- No pricing premium
- Best for applications where data residency is flexible
- Only supports pay-as-you-go traffic (provisioned throughput requires regional endpoints)

**Regional endpoints:**

- Route traffic through specific geographic regions
- Required for data residency and compliance requirements
- Support both pay-as-you-go and provisioned throughput
- 10% pricing premium reflects infrastructure costs for dedicated regional capacity

### Implementation

**Using global endpoints (recommended):**

Set the `region` parameter to `"global"` when initializing the client:

Python

```
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex

project_id = "MY_PROJECT_ID"
region = "global"

client = AnthropicVertex(project_id=project_id, region=region)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Hey Claude!",\
        }\
    ],
)
print(message)
```

**Using regional endpoints:**

Specify a specific region like `"us-east1"` or `"europe-west1"`:

Python

```
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex

project_id = "MY_PROJECT_ID"
region = "us-east1"  # Specify a specific region

client = AnthropicVertex(project_id=project_id, region=region)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Hey Claude!",\
        }\
    ],
)
print(message)
```
