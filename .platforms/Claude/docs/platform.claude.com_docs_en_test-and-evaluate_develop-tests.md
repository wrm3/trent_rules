Define success and build evaluations

Copy page

Building a successful LLM-based application starts with clearly defining your success criteria and then designing evaluations to measure performance against them. This cycle is central to prompt engineering.

## Define your success criteria

Good success criteria are:

- **Specific:** Clearly define what you want to achieve. Instead of "good performance," specify "accurate sentiment classification."

- **Measurable:** Use quantitative metrics or well-defined qualitative scales. Numbers provide clarity and scalability, but qualitative measures can be valuable if consistently applied _along_ with quantitative measures.


  - Even "hazy" topics such as ethics and safety can be quantified:



    |  | Safety criteria |
    | --- | --- |
    | Bad | Safe outputs |
    | Good | Less than 0.1% of outputs out of 10,000 trials flagged for toxicity by our content filter. |


### Example metrics and measurement methods

- **Achievable:** Base your targets on industry benchmarks, prior experiments, AI research, or expert knowledge. Your success metrics should not be unrealistic to current frontier model capabilities.

- **Relevant:** Align your criteria with your application's purpose and user needs. Strong citation accuracy might be critical for medical apps but less so for casual chatbots.


### Example task fidelity criteria for sentiment analysis

### Common success criteria

Here are some criteria that might be important for your use case. This list is non-exhaustive.

### Task fidelity

### Consistency

### Relevance and coherence

### Tone and style

### Privacy preservation

### Context utilization

### Latency

### Price

Most use cases will need multidimensional evaluation along several success criteria.

## Build evaluations

### Eval design principles

1. **Be task-specific:** Design evals that mirror your real-world task distribution. Don't forget to factor in edge cases!




### Example edge cases

2. **Automate when possible:** Structure questions to allow for automated grading (e.g., multiple-choice, string match, code-graded, LLM-graded).
3. **Prioritize volume over quality:** More questions with slightly lower signal automated grading is better than fewer questions with high-quality human hand-graded evals.

### Example evals

### Task fidelity (sentiment analysis) - exact match evaluation

### Consistency (FAQ bot) - cosine similarity evaluation

### Relevance and coherence (summarization) - ROUGE-L evaluation

### Tone and style (customer service) - LLM-based Likert scale

### Privacy preservation (medical chatbot) - LLM-based binary classification

### Context utilization (conversation assistant) - LLM-based ordinal scale

## Grade your evaluations

When deciding which method to use to grade evals, choose the fastest, most reliable, most scalable method:

1. **Code-based grading:** Fastest and most reliable, extremely scalable, but also lacks nuance for more complex judgements that require less rule-based rigidity.
   - Exact match: `output == golden_answer`
   - String match: `key_phrase in output`
2. **Human grading:** Most flexible and high quality, but slow and expensive. Avoid if possible.

3. **LLM-based grading:** Fast and flexible, scalable and suitable for complex judgement. Test to ensure reliability first then scale.


### Tips for LLM-based grading

- **Have detailed, clear rubrics:** "The answer should always mention 'Acme Inc.' in the first sentence. If it does not, the answer is automatically graded as 'incorrect.'"











A given use case, or even a specific success criteria for that use case, might require several rubrics for holistic evaluation.

- **Empirical or specific:** For example, instruct the LLM to output only 'correct' or 'incorrect', or to judge from a scale of 1-5. Purely qualitative evaluations are hard to assess quickly and at scale.
- **Encourage reasoning:** Ask the LLM to think first before deciding an evaluation score, and then discard the reasoning. This increases evaluation performance, particularly for tasks requiring complex judgement.
