# Retrieval Augmented Generation

Claude excels at a wide range of tasks, but it may struggle with queries specific to your unique business context. This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes invaluable. RAG enables Claude to leverage your internal knowledge bases or customer support documents, significantly enhancing its ability to answer domain-specific questions. Enterprises are increasingly building RAG applications to improve workflows in customer support, Q&A over internal company documents, financial & legal analysis, and much more.

In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to build and optimize a RAG system using the Claude Documentation as our knowledge base. We'll walk you through:

1. Setting up a basic RAG system using an in-memory vector database and embeddings from [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/).

2. Building a robust evaluation suite. We'll go beyond 'vibes' based evals and show you how to measure the retrieval pipeine & end to end performance independently.

3. Implementing advanced techniques to improve RAG including summary indexing and re-ranking with Claude.


Through a series of targeted improvements, we achieved significant performance gains on the following metrics compared to a basic RAG pipeline (we'll explain what all these metrics _mean_ in a bit)

- Avg Precision: 0.43 --> 0.44
- Avg Recall: 0.66 --> 0.69
- Avg F1 Score: 0.52 --> 0.54
- Avg Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): 0.74 --> 0.87
- End-to-End Accuracy: 71% --> 81%

#### Note:

The evaluations in this cookbook are meant to mirror a production evaluation system, and you should keep in mind that they can take a while to run. Also of note: if you run the evaluations in full, you may come up against rate limits unless you are in [Tier 2 and above](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/rate-limits). Consider skipping the full end to end eval if you're trying to conserve token usage.

## Table of Contents

1. Setup

2. Level 1 - Basic RAG

3. Building an Evaluation System

4. Level 2 - Summary Indexing

5. Level 3 - Summary Indexing and Re-Ranking


## Setup

We'll need a few libraries, including:

1. `anthropic` \- to interact with Claude

2. `voyageai` \- to generate high quality embeddings

3. `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for data manipulation and visualization


You'll also need API keys from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) and [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/)

python

```
## setup
!pip install anthropic
!pip install voyageai
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install seaborn
!pip install -U scikit-learn
```

### Initialize a Vector DB Class

In this example, we're using an in-memory vector DB, but for a production application, you may want to use a hosted solution.

python

```
import json
import os
import pickle

import numpy as np
import voyageai


class VectorDB:
    def __init__(self, name, api_key=None):
        if api_key is None:
            api_key = os.getenv("VOYAGE_API_KEY")
        self.client = voyageai.Client(api_key=api_key)
        self.name = name
        self.embeddings = []
        self.metadata = []
        self.query_cache = {}

            print("Loading vector database from disk.")
            self.load_db()
            return

        texts = [f"Heading: {item['chunk_heading']}\n\n Chunk Text:{item['text']}" for item in data]

            for i in range(0, len(texts), batch_size)\
        ]
        self.embeddings = [embedding for batch in result for embedding in batch]
        self.metadata = data

    def search(self, query, k=5, similarity_threshold=0.75):

            if similarities[idx] >= similarity_threshold:
                example = {
                    "metadata": self.metadata[idx],
                    "similarity": similarities[idx],
                }
                top_examples.append(example)

        }
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(self.db_path), exist_ok=True)
        with open(self.db_path, "wb") as file:
            pickle.dump(data, file)

    def load_db(self):
        if not os.path.exists(self.db_path):
            raise ValueError(
                "Vector database file not found. Use load_data to create a new database."
            )
        with open(self.db_path, "rb") as file:
            data = pickle.load(file)
        self.embeddings = data["embeddings"]

        self.query_cache = json.loads(data["query_cache"])
```

## Level 1 - Basic RAG

To get started, we'll set up a basic RAG pipeline using a bare bones approach. This is sometimes called 'Naive RAG' by many in the industry. A basic RAG pipeline includes the following 3 steps:

1. Chunk documents by heading - containing only the content from each subheading

2. Embed each document

3. Use Cosine similarity to retrieve documents in order to answer query


python

```
import json
import logging
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET  # noqa: S314
from collections.abc import Callable
from typing import Any

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tqdm import tqdm

# Load the evaluation dataset
with open("evaluation/docs_evaluation_dataset.json") as f:
    eval_data = json.load(f)

# Load the Claude Documentation
with open("data/anthropic_docs.json") as f:
    anthropic_docs = json.load(f)

# Initialize the VectorDB
db = VectorDB("anthropic_docs")
db.load_data(anthropic_docs)


def retrieve_base(query, db):
    results = db.search(query, k=3)
    context = ""
    for result in results:
        chunk = result["metadata"]
        context += f"\n{chunk['text']}\n"
    return results, context


def answer_query_base(query, db):
    documents, context = retrieve_base(query, db)
    prompt = f"""
    You have been tasked with helping us to answer the following query:
    <query>

    </query>
    You have access to the following documents which are meant to provide context as you answer the query:

    """
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-haiku-4-5",
        max_tokens=2500,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0,
    )
    return response.content[0].text
```

## Eval Setup

When evaluating RAG applications, it's critical to evaluate the performance of the retrieval system and end to end system separately.

We synthetically generated an evaluation dataset consisting of 100 samples which include the following:

- A question
- Chunks from our docs which are relevant to that question. This is what we expect our retrieval system to retrieve when the question is asked
- A correct answer to the question.

This is a relatively challenging dataset. Some of our questions require synthesis between more than one chunk in order to be answered correctly, so it's important that our system can load in more than one chunk at a time. You can inspect the dataset by opening `evaluation/docs_evaluation_dataset.json`

Run the next cell to see a preview of the dataset

python

```
# previewing our eval dataset

def preview_json(file_path, num_items=3):
    try:
        with open(file_path) as file:
            data = json.load(file)

        if isinstance(data, list):
            preview_data = data[:num_items]
        elif isinstance(data, dict):
            preview_data = dict(list(data.items())[:num_items])
        else:
            print(f"Unexpected data type: {type(data)}. Cannot preview.")
            return

        print(f"Preview of the first {num_items} items from {file_path}:")
        print(json.dumps(preview_data, indent=2))
        print(f"\nTotal number of items: {len(data)}")

# Metric Definitions

We'll evaluate our system based on 5 key metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and End-to-End Accuracy.

## Retrieval Metrics:

### Precision

Precision represents the proportion of retrieved chunks that are actually relevant. It answers the question: "Of the chunks we retrieved, how many were correct?"

Key points:

- High precision indicates an efficient system with few false positives.
- Low precision suggests many irrelevant chunks are being retrieved.
- Our system retrieves a minimum of 3 chunks per query, which may affect precision scores.

Formula:

Precision=True PositivesTotal Retrieved=∣Retrieved∩Correct∣∣Retrieved∣\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{Total Retrieved}} = \\frac{\|\\text{Retrieved} \\cap \\text{Correct}\|}{\|\\text{Retrieved}\|}Precision=Total RetrievedTrue Positives​=∣Retrieved∣∣Retrieved∩Correct∣​

### Recall

Recall measures the completeness of our retrieval system. It answers the question: "Of all the correct chunks that exist, how many did we manage to retrieve?"

Key points:

- High recall indicates comprehensive coverage of necessary information.
- Low recall suggests important chunks are being missed.
- Recall is crucial for ensuring the LLM has access to all needed information.

Formula:

Recall=True PositivesTotal Correct=∣Retrieved∩Correct∣∣Correct∣\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{Total Correct}} = \\frac{\|\\text{Retrieved} \\cap \\text{Correct}\|}{\|\\text{Correct}\|}Recall=Total CorrectTrue Positives​=∣Correct∣∣Retrieved∩Correct∣​

### F1 Score

The F1 score provides a balanced measure between precision and recall. It's particularly useful when you need a single metric to evaluate system performance, especially with uneven class distributions.

Key points:

- F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect precision and recall.
- It's the harmonic mean of precision and recall, tending towards the lower of the two values.
- Useful in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives are important.

Formula:

F1 Score=2×Precision×RecallPrecision+Recall\\text{F1 Score} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}F1 Score=2×Precision+RecallPrecision×Recall​

Interpreting F1 score:

- An F1 score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.
- An F1 score of 0.0 indicates the worst performance.
- Generally, the higher the F1 score, the better the overall performance.

### Balancing Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:

- There's often a trade-off between precision and recall.
- Our system's minimum chunk retrieval favors recall over precision.
- The optimal balance depends on the specific use case.
- In many RAG systems, high recall is often prioritized, as LLMs can filter out less relevant information during generation.

### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) @k

MRR measures how well our system ranks relevant information. It helps us understand how quickly a user would find what they're looking for if they started from the top of our retrieved results.

Key points:

- MRR ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect (correct answer always first).
- It only considers the rank of the first correct result for each query.
- Higher MRR indicates better ranking of relevant information.

Formula:

MRR=1∣Q∣∑i=1∣Q∣1ranki\\text{MRR} = \\frac{1}{\|Q\|} \\sum\_{i=1}^{\|Q\|} \\frac{1}{\\text{rank}\_i}MRR=∣Q∣1​i=1∑∣Q∣​ranki​1​

Where:

- \|Q\| is the total number of queries
- rank\_i is the position of the first relevant item for the i-th query

## End to End Metrics:

### End to End Accuracy

We use an LLM-as-judge (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to evaluate whether the generated answer is correct based on the question and ground truth answer.

Formula:

End to End Accuracy=Number of Correct AnswersTotal Number of Questions\\text{End to End Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Correct Answers}}{\\text{Total Number of Questions}}End to End Accuracy=Total Number of QuestionsNumber of Correct Answers​

This metric evaluates the entire pipeline, from retrieval to answer generation.

Evaluating End-to-End:   1%|          | 1/100 [00:05<08:35,  5.21s/it]

The generated answer is incorrect. While it provides general guidance about test case creation, it misses the specific, critical information about HOW to actually create multiple test cases in the Anthropic Evaluation tool. The correct answer clearly states that you need to click the 'Add Test Case' button and fill in values for variables in your prompt. The generated answer instead talks about theoretical steps like organizing test cases in spreadsheets or JSON files, which isn't mentioned in the correct answer and may not be accurate. The generated answer seems to be providing general testing best practices rather than the specific mechanics of creating multiple test cases in the Anthropic Evaluation tool.
false

Evaluating End-to-End:   2%|▏         | 2/100 [00:10<08:21,  5.12s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct in substance compared to the Correct Answer. Both answers identify Voyage AI as Anthropic's recommended embeddings provider and both mention that Voyage AI offers customized/fine-tuned models for specific domains and individual customers. While the Generated Answer provides more specific details about Voyage AI's model offerings that aren't mentioned in the Correct Answer, this additional information doesn't contradict the Correct Answer - it merely elaborates on it. The core claims about Voyage AI's capabilities for domain-specific customization and bespoke fine-tuning are consistent between both answers.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   3%|▎         | 3/100 [00:16<08:45,  5.41s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct as it covers all the key points mentioned in the Correct Answer and even provides additional helpful details. Both answers mention the same key success metrics: accuracy, F1 score, consistency, structure, speed, and bias/fairness. Both answers also discuss how choosing the right model affects latency and performance. While the Generated Answer goes into more specific detail about model choices (mentioning claude-3-haiku and Sonnet specifically), this additional information doesn't contradict the Correct Answer - it simply elaborates on it. The core message about balancing speed and output quality is consistent between both answers.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   4%|▍         | 4/100 [00:20<08:18,  5.19s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct as it captures the same two key benefits of Claude for Sheets mentioned in the Correct Answer:

1. Both answers mention the ability to test prompts across evaluation suites in parallel (with the Correct Answer adding that this is faster than sequential chained prompts)

2. Both answers mention that Claude for Sheets is better at office tasks like survey analysis and data processing

While the Correct Answer explicitly mentions that parallel testing is "faster than running chained prompts sequentially," this additional detail doesn't change the core point being made. The Generated Answer captures the essential substance of both key benefits, just with slightly different wording.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   5%|▌         | 5/100 [00:25<07:44,  4.89s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. Both answers convey the same core information - that missing the "\n\nHuman:" and "\n\nAssistant:" turns in the prompt will result in an API error. The Generated Answer actually provides slightly more context by explaining that these turns are expected to indicate the start of human input and assistant response, but this additional detail doesn't change the fundamental correctness of the answer. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and no critical information is missing from the Generated Answer.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   6%|▌         | 6/100 [00:31<08:33,  5.46s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It captures all the key points from the Correct Answer:

1. It correctly states that tool use requests are priced the same way as regular API requests
2. It accurately lists all the additional token sources that contribute to the total cost:

The Generated Answer is incorrect because it misses a critical component from the Correct Answer. While both answers discuss latency implications of CoT, the Generated Answer fails to mention one of the key decision factors - whether the task requires in-depth thinking that a human would need to work through. The Generated Answer focuses heavily on performance and latency considerations, essentially repeating the same point twice, but doesn't address the fundamental question of whether the task's complexity actually warrants using CoT in the first place. This is a significant omission since it's one of the two key factors mentioned in the Correct Answer for determining when CoT is appropriate.

The generated answer is incorrect when compared to the correct answer. While the generated answer provides several valid metrics for evaluating a classification system (F1 score, consistency, structure, speed, bias/fairness), it misses the specific metrics mentioned in the correct answer. The correct answer specifically mentions two key metrics: 95th percentile response time and average cost per classification. While the generated answer does mention "speed" in general terms, it doesn't mention cost at all, which is a critical metric specified in the correct answer. The generated answer provides different metrics that, while potentially useful, are not the specific metrics outlined in what appears to be Anthropic's documentation.

The generated answer, while detailed and structured, misses a key element from the correct answer. The correct answer specifically mentions using tags like  and  in combination with chain of thought reasoning where Claude explains its step-by-step thinking process. While the generated answer does discuss using XML tags and breaking down tasks into steps, it doesn't explicitly mention the core concept of using  tags to prompt Claude to show its reasoning process.

The generated answer focuses more on a general methodology of breaking down tasks and using XML tags for structure, rather than the specific combination of XML tags with chain of thought reasoning that the correct answer describes. The correct answer provides a more focused and specific approach about using tags to explicitly prompt Claude's reasoning process.

Additionally, the correct answer provides a specific example of how to prompt Claude ("Before answering, explain your reasoning step-by-step in  tags"), which is a crucial piece of information missing from the generated answer.

The generated answer is incorrect for several reasons:

1. While it correctly identifies the three general types of metrics (accuracy, cost, and speed), the specific numerical results provided are significantly different from the correct answer:
- Generated answer claims 92% accuracy vs correct 89.01%
- Generated answer claims $0.03 cost vs correct $0.0004 per request
- Generated answer claims 50ms speed vs correct 1.61 seconds (95th percentile)

2. The speed metric is described differently - the correct answer specifically mentions "95th percentile response time" while the generated answer just refers to "average latency"

3. The cost metric is described differently - the correct answer specifies "cost per request routing" while the generated answer refers to total cost

These differences represent material discrepancies in the actual performance metrics, making the generated answer incorrect despite correctly identifying the three general categories of metrics being measured.

The generated answer is incorrect. While it provides detailed steps for implementing Claude more broadly, it does not match the specific pre-prompt engineering requirements mentioned in the correct answer. The correct answer focuses on three key elements that should be in place before starting prompt engineering:
1. Clear definition of success criteria
2. Ways to empirically test against those criteria
3. A first draft prompt to improve

The generated answer instead discusses broader implementation steps like scoping use cases, designing integrations, and preparing data. While these may be useful steps generally, they are not the specific prerequisites for prompt engineering that Anthropic recommends according to the correct answer. The answers are fundamentally discussing different things.

In fact, the Generated Answer goes into even more specific detail about how the analysis differs, breaking down concrete examples of the improvements (like flagging CAC concerns and providing strategic recommendations). While it provides more granular details than the Correct Answer, it does not contradict anything in the Correct Answer and maintains the same core message about the role-based prompt leading to more insightful and structured analysis. The key comparison point about the quality difference between role-based and non-role-based responses is preserved in both answers.

1. It mentions key quantitative metrics, including F1 score, accuracy, and other relevant metrics, which aligns with the Correct Answer's mention of "F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall."

2. It discusses how targets should be determined, mentioning industry benchmarks and prior experiments, which directly matches the Correct Answer's statement about basing targets on "industry benchmarks, prior experiments, AI research, or expert knowledge."

While the Generated Answer provides more specific examples and additional metrics (like response time and toxicity), this additional detail doesn't contradict the Correct Answer - it merely expands upon it. The core substance of both answers is aligned: they both emphasize the importance of quantitative metrics and describe how targets should be determined based on industry standards and prior work.

1. It explains that you need to provide both the output to grade and a detailed rubric to Claude
2. It indicates that the LLM should evaluate based on the rubric criteria
3. It mentions that the output should be a simple correct/incorrect judgment

While the Generated Answer goes into more detail and provides additional implementation steps, it doesn't contradict anything in the Correct Answer. The core concept - using Claude to evaluate outputs against a rubric and provide a correct/incorrect judgment - is preserved. The additional detail simply elaborates on how to implement this approach practically.

1. Using a single tool
2. Setting tool_choice explicitly
3. Ensuring tool names/descriptions are from the model's perspective

The generated answer instead focuses on schema definition, error handling, and testing, which, while potentially useful, are not the key points emphasized in the correct answer about tool setup and prompting. The generated answer does not mention the important aspect of tool_choice configuration or the perspective from which tools should be defined.

The generated answer is incorrect for two key reasons:

1. It directly contradicts the correct answer regarding speed. The correct answer states that Claude 3 Haiku is "faster" than Claude Instant 1.2, while the generated answer incorrectly states that "Claude Instant 1.2 model is described as a 'fast and efficient' predecessor" and implies it's faster than Claude 3 Haiku.

2. It includes potentially incorrect or unverified information about costs and context windows that isn't mentioned in the correct answer, which could be misleading.

While the generated answer correctly identifies some aspects like vision capabilities and improved performance of Claude 3 Haiku, the contradiction regarding speed is a significant error that makes the answer incorrect overall. The correct answer is simpler and clearly states that Claude 3 Haiku is faster, more performant, and more intelligent, with vision capabilities and more up-to-date training data.

The Correct Answer specifies that images must be provided as base64-encoded content blocks within the messages array, while the Generated Answer incorrectly states that image files can be uploaded directly to the API. This is a fundamental technical difference in how images should be formatted and included in the request.

While the Generated Answer correctly lists the supported image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP) and provides additional useful information about file size limits and usage restrictions, it misses the crucial technical requirement of base64 encoding.

The Generated Answer is incorrect. The Correct Answer states that users can experiment with Claude through claude.ai and Anthropic's web Console, while the Generated Answer mentions completely different methods - using the API Quickstart and Workbench. These are substantively different approaches and do not align with what's stated in the Correct Answer. The Generated Answer misses both key methods mentioned in the Correct Answer (claude.ai and web Console) and instead provides different information. This represents a material difference in the substance of the answers, not just minor wording variations.

The Generated Answer is correct. Both answers convey the same core concept that chain prompts help reduce errors and inconsistencies by breaking complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks that Claude can focus on individually. While the Generated Answer provides more detailed explanations and additional benefits (like traceability and debugging), it doesn't contradict the Correct Answer. The fundamental principle - that breaking tasks into smaller pieces helps reduce errors and maintain consistency - is preserved in both answers. The additional details in the Generated Answer simply elaborate on the basic concept without changing its essential meaning.

The Generated Answer is correct as it conveys the same essential information as the Correct Answer. Both answers explain that:

1. Tool use content blocks are sent as partial JSON strings in content_block_delta events
2. The client needs to accumulate these partial JSON strings
3. The complete JSON can be parsed once a content_block_stop event is received
4. Parsing can be done using Pydantic or SDK helpers

The Generated Answer actually provides additional helpful detail by showing an example of the delta structure, but this doesn't contradict anything in the Correct Answer. The core concepts and process are described accurately and consistently between both answers.

The Generated Answer is incorrect because it directly contradicts the Correct Answer. The Correct Answer specifically states that Claude 3 Sonnet provides the best balance of intelligence and speed for high-throughput tasks, while the Generated Answer claims that Claude 3 Haiku is the best model for these tasks. This is a fundamental disagreement about which model is most appropriate for these use cases. While both answers discuss balance between speed and intelligence, they reach opposite conclusions about which model achieves the optimal balance for high-throughput tasks like sales forecasting and targeted marketing. The fact that the Generated Answer provides detailed reasoning doesn't make it correct when it contradicts the core claim of the Correct Answer.

The Generated Answer is correct. It accurately identifies and describes both types of content block deltas:

1. It correctly identifies "Input JSON delta" and explains that it contains partial JSON strings for tool input, which aligns with the Correct Answer's description of deltas containing a "partial_json" field with parts of the JSON object for tool input.

2. It correctly identifies "Text delta" and explains that it contains text updates, which matches the Correct Answer's description of text deltas containing text strings.

While the exact wording differs between the two answers, the substance and key information about both types of deltas are effectively the same. The Generated Answer even provides some additional context about how the deltas work (like mentioning content_block_stop events), but this extra information doesn't contradict the Correct Answer.

Evaluating End-to-End:  62%|██████▏   | 62/100 [05:30<03:20,  5.27s/it]

The Generated Answer is incorrect because it focuses on different capabilities than those mentioned in the Correct Answer. The Correct Answer specifically highlights Claude's question answering and text analysis capabilities (including sentiment analysis and preference understanding) as key enablers for interactive systems and personalization. In contrast, the Generated Answer discusses multimodal input and tool use/function calling capabilities. While these are indeed capabilities of Claude, they are not the specific capabilities highlighted in the Correct Answer for building interactive systems and personalizing user experiences. The Generated Answer, therefore, misses the core capabilities mentioned in the Correct Answer and instead provides different ones.

1. It mentions the message_start event coming first
2. It describes the content block sequence (start, delta, stop)
3. It includes the message_delta events
4. It notes the final message_stop event
5. It mentions that ping events can occur throughout

The Generated Answer actually provides slightly more detail by mentioning that the message_start contains a Message object with empty content, but this additional detail doesn't contradict the Correct Answer. The substance and sequence of events is identical between both answers.

Evaluating End-to-End:  65%|██████▌   | 65/100 [05:45<03:03,  5.24s/it]

The Generated Answer is incorrect. The two answers provide fundamentally different solutions to the problem:

1. Correct Answer: Simply increase the max_tokens parameter to get the complete response from Claude, including the full tool use block.

2. Generated Answer: Extract partial information from the incomplete tool use, execute the tool client-side, and continue the conversation with the tool results.

These are contradictory approaches. The Correct Answer provides a straightforward solution of just increasing max_tokens, while the Generated Answer suggests a more complex workaround that involves parsing incomplete tool use blocks and executing them client-side, which is not the recommended approach according to the documentation.

The Generated Answer misses the key point that the simple solution is to increase max_tokens, and instead proposes a different and more complicated approach that could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

The Correct Answer states that you need to "take a look at Anthropic's guide to developing test cases" while the Generated Answer states you need to "build a strong input prompt." These are substantively different steps. The Generated Answer misses the critical piece about consulting Anthropic's guide, which is specifically mentioned in the Correct Answer, and instead introduces a different step that isn't mentioned in the Correct Answer.

The Generated Answer simply provides more detail and elaboration about what higher and lower temperatures do specifically, but the fundamental meaning matches the Correct Answer. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and the Generated Answer includes all critical information from the Correct Answer while expanding on it.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:  93%|█████████▎| 93/100 [08:10<00:31,  4.54s/it]

The Generated Answer is incorrect because it misses one of the key ways to specify API parameters mentioned in the Correct Answer. While it correctly identifies that parameters can be added as additional arguments after the prompt and model (like max_tokens), it completely omits the second way mentioned in the Correct Answer - the ability to pass in an API key for a specific cell using "api_key". Instead, the Generated Answer discusses how to make a simple prompt call, which wasn't one of the two parameter specification methods described in the Correct Answer. Since it's missing this critical piece of information about API key specification, the answer cannot be considered fully correct.
false

Evaluating End-to-End:  94%|█████████▍| 94/100 [08:14<00:26,  4.35s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. Both answers convey the same key points:
1. Prefilling with { makes Claude skip the preamble/explanation
2. It causes Claude to output directly as JSON
3. The result is more concise and easier for programs to parse

The Generated Answer captures all the essential information from the Correct Answer, just using slightly different wording. There are no contradictions or missing critical pieces of information. The substance and meaning are equivalent.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:  95%|█████████▌| 95/100 [08:19<00:22,  4.58s/it]

The generated answer is partially correct but contains extra information that is not verified by the correct answer. The first two points about the multimodal cookbook and API reference documentation match the correct answer's substance. However, the third point about the developer community is not mentioned in the correct answer and cannot be verified as accurate. Since this additional information goes beyond what's confirmed in the correct answer but doesn't contradict the core accurate information, and since all the key elements from the correct answer (cookbook and API documentation) are present in the generated answer, this can still be considered substantially correct.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:  96%|█████████▌| 96/100 [08:26<00:20,  5.11s/it]

The generated answer is incorrect for several reasons:

1. While it correctly shows that you can specify the API key either through environment variables or directly when creating the client, the TypeScript example is completely wrong as it uses OpenAI's SDK syntax instead of Anthropic's.

2. The core substance of how to specify the API key is technically present, but showing incorrect SDK usage could be very misleading for developers.

3. The correct answer provides a simpler, more general explanation that captures the key points without implementation details, while the generated answer includes specific code examples but gets the TypeScript implementation wrong.

Even though the Python portion is accurate and the general concept of specifying API keys is present, providing incorrect SDK information makes this answer problematic enough to be considered incorrect overall.
false

Evaluating End-to-End:  97%|█████████▋| 97/100 [08:30<00:14,  4.97s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It captures the same two key benefits mentioned in the Correct Answer:

1. Both answers mention identifying edge cases where prompts might fail/falter
2. Both answers discuss ensuring consistent performance across different inputs/test cases

The Generated Answer breaks these points down in a slightly different format but conveys the same core information. The substance and meaning are equivalent, with both answers focusing on how the tool helps identify problems and ensure reliability across different scenarios. There are no missing critical pieces of information or contradictions between the two answers.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:  98%|█████████▊| 98/100 [08:37<00:10,  5.47s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct in substance. Both answers emphasize the key distinction that the pretrained model lacks inherent capabilities for following instructions and being helpful, while the final Claude model available through the API has been enhanced through fine-tuning and RLHF to be more capable and aligned with human needs. While the Generated Answer goes into more detail about specific aspects like prompt engineering, cost, and latency, these additional points don't contradict the core message of the Correct Answer. The fundamental transformation from a basic language model to a helpful AI assistant through fine-tuning and RLHF is captured in both answers.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:  99%|█████████▉| 99/100 [08:39<00:04,  4.60s/it]

The Generated Answer is exactly identical to the Correct Answer, stating that Anthropic's IPv6 address range is 2607:6bc0::/48. There are no differences in wording or substance, and all critical information is present.
true

Evaluating End-to-End: 100%|██████████| 100/100 [08:45<00:00,  5.25s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It describes the same two methods for specifying the API key as mentioned in the Correct Answer:

1. Passing the API key directly when initializing the Anthropic client
2. Setting it as an environment variable named ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

The Generated Answer even provides helpful code examples to illustrate both methods, though these weren't required to match the Correct Answer. The substance and key information is identical between both answers, just expressed in slightly different words.

# Level 2: Document Summarization for Enhanced Retrieval

In this section, we'll implement an improved approach to our retrieval system by incorporating document summaries. Instead of embedding chunks directly from the documents, we'll create a concise summary for each chunk and use this summary along with the original content in our embedding process.

This approach aims to capture the essence of each document chunk more effectively, potentially leading to improved retrieval performance.

Key steps in this process:

1. We load the original document chunks.
2. For each chunk, we generate a 2-3 sentence summary using Claude.
3. We store both the original content and the summary for each chunk in a new json file: `data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json`

This summary-enhanced approach is designed to provide more context during the embedding and retrieval phases, potentially improving the system's ability to understand and match the most relevant documents to user queries.

## Generating the Summaries and Storing Them

python

```
import json

from tqdm import tqdm


def generate_summaries(input_file, output_file):
    # Load the original documents
    with open(input_file) as f:
        docs = json.load(f)

    # Prepare the context about the overall knowledge base
    knowledge_base_context = "This is documentation for Anthropic's, a frontier AI lab building Claude, an LLM that excels at a variety of general purpose tasks. These docs contain model details and documentation on Anthropic's APIs."

    summarized_docs = []

    for doc in tqdm(docs, desc="Generating summaries"):
        prompt = f"""
        You are tasked with creating a short summary of the following content from Anthropic's documentation.

        Context about the knowledge base:
        {knowledge_base_context}

        Content to summarize:
        Heading: {doc["chunk_heading"]}
        {doc["text"]}

        Please provide a brief summary of the above content in 2-3 sentences. The summary should capture the key points and be concise. We will be using it as a key part of our search pipeline when answering user queries about this content.

        Avoid using any preamble whatsoever in your response. Statements such as 'here is the summary' or 'the summary is as follows' are prohibited. You should get straight into the summary itself and be concise. Every word matters.
        """

        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-haiku-4-5",
            max_tokens=150,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0,
        )

        summary = response.content[0].text.strip()

        summarized_doc = {
            "chunk_link": doc["chunk_link"],
            "chunk_heading": doc["chunk_heading"],
            "text": doc["text"],
            "summary": summary,
        }
        summarized_docs.append(summarized_doc)

    # Save the summarized documents to a new JSON file
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump(summarized_docs, f, indent=2)

    print(f"Summaries generated and saved to {output_file}")


# generate_summaries('data/anthropic_docs.json', 'data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json')
```

# Summary-Indexed Vector Database Creation

Here, we're creating a new vector database that incorporates our summary-enhanced document chunks. This approach combines the original text, the chunk heading, and the newly generated summary into a single text for embedding.

Key features of this process:

1. We create embeddings for the combined text (heading + summary + original content) using the Voyage AI API.
2. The embeddings and full metadata (including summaries) are stored in our vector database.
3. We implement caching mechanisms to improve efficiency in repeated queries.
4. The database is saved to disk for persistence and quick loading in future sessions.

This summary-indexed approach aims to create more informative embeddings, potentially leading to more accurate and contextually relevant document retrieval.

# Enhanced Retrieval Using Summary-Indexed Embeddings

In this section, we implement the retrieval process using our new summary-indexed vector database. This approach leverages the enhanced embeddings we created, which incorporate document summaries along with the original content.

Key aspects of this updated retrieval process:

1. We search the vector database using the query embedding, retrieving the top k most similar documents.
2. For each retrieved document, we include the chunk heading, summary, and full text in the context provided to the LLM.
3. This enriched context is then used to generate an answer to the user's query.

By including summaries in both the embedding and retrieval phases, we aim to provide the LLM with a more comprehensive and focused context. This could potentially lead to more accurate and relevant answers, as the LLM has access to both a concise overview (the summary) and the detailed information (the full text) for each relevant document chunk.

python

```
def retrieve_level_two(query, db):
    results = db.search(query, k=3)
    context = ""
    for result in results:
        chunk = result["metadata"]
        context += f"\n <document> \n {chunk['chunk_heading']}\n\nText\n {chunk['text']} \n\nSummary: \n {chunk['summary']} \n </document> \n"  # show model all 3 items

The Generated Answer is correct. It contains all the key information from the Correct Answer about creating multiple test cases - specifically that you need to click the 'Add Test Case' button and fill in values for variables in your prompt for each new test case. While the Generated Answer provides additional details about running the evaluation suite and updating prompts, these extra details don't contradict the core information, they just provide supplementary context. The fundamental process described for creating multiple test cases is the same in both answers.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   2%|▏         | 2/100 [00:10<08:26,  5.17s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It captures the key points from the Correct Answer:
1. It correctly identifies Voyage AI as Anthropic's recommended embeddings provider
2. It mentions that Voyage AI offers customized/domain-specific models
3. It notes that Voyage AI provides bespoke fine-tuned models for individual customers
4. It mentions specific domains like finance and healthcare

While the Generated Answer provides more specific details about Voyage AI's model offerings that aren't mentioned in the Correct Answer, this additional information doesn't contradict anything in the Correct Answer - it simply provides more detail. The core substance of both answers is the same: Voyage AI is recommended and offers both domain-specific and customized models.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   3%|▎         | 3/100 [00:15<08:43,  5.40s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct as it covers all the key points mentioned in the Correct Answer and even provides additional helpful details. Both answers mention the same key success metrics: accuracy, F1 score, consistency, structure, speed, and bias/fairness. Both answers also address the relationship between model choice and latency. While the Generated Answer provides more specific details about model options (mentioning claude-3-haiku and Sonnet specifically), this additional detail doesn't contradict the Correct Answer but rather expands upon it. The core message about choosing the right model to reduce latency while meeting performance requirements is consistent between both answers.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   4%|▍         | 4/100 [00:19<07:45,  4.84s/it]

The generated answer is partially correct but misses a key element from the correct answer. While both answers correctly identify parallel evaluation/testing as one advantage, the second point differs significantly. The correct answer specifically mentions Claude for Sheets' excellence at office tasks like survey analysis and online data processing, while the generated answer instead talks about an integrated workflow and centralized environment. This represents a substantial difference in the functionality being described. Since one of the two key advantages is missing from the generated answer, it cannot be considered fully correct.
false

Evaluating End-to-End:   5%|▌         | 5/100 [00:24<07:29,  4.73s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. Both answers convey the same core information - that missing the "\n\nHuman:" and "\n\nAssistant:" turns in the prompt will result in an API error. The Generated Answer actually provides slightly more context by explaining that these turns are expected to indicate the start of human input and assistant response, but this additional detail doesn't change the fundamental correctness of the answer. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and no critical information from the Correct Answer is missing from the Generated Answer.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   6%|▌         | 6/100 [00:30<08:16,  5.28s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It captures all the key points from the Correct Answer:

1. It correctly states that tool use requests are priced the same way as regular API requests
2. It accurately lists all the additional token sources that contribute to the total cost:
   - Tools parameter
   - Tool use content blocks
   - Tool result content blocks
   - Special system prompt
3. It explains that these additional tokens are added to the normal input/output tokens to calculate the total cost

The Generated Answer actually provides slightly more detail than the Correct Answer, but doesn't contradict it in any way. The core message that tool use requests follow the same pricing structure but include additional tokens that affect the total cost is preserved in both answers.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:   7%|▋         | 7/100 [00:34<07:15,  4.69s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It contains all the essential information from the Correct Answer - specifically the release date (June 27th, 2024) and what features will be available (API usage, billing details, and rate limits). While the Correct Answer provides slightly more detail by mentioning the specific tabs (Usage, Cost, and Rate Limits), this is a minor detail that doesn't change the core meaning.

The Generated Answer is incorrect because it misses a critical element from the Correct Answer. While both answers discuss latency implications of CoT, the Generated Answer fails to mention one of the key decision factors - whether the task requires in-depth thinking that a human would need to work through. The Generated Answer focuses heavily on performance and latency considerations, essentially repeating the same point twice, but doesn't address the fundamental question of whether the task's complexity actually warrants using CoT in the first place. This is a significant omission since it's one of the two key factors mentioned in the Correct Answer for determining when CoT is appropriate.

The generated answer is incorrect when compared to the correct answer. While the generated answer provides several reasonable metrics for evaluating a ticket classification system, it misses the specific key metrics mentioned in the correct answer: the 95th percentile response time and average cost per classification. The generated answer discusses cost and speed in more general terms, but doesn't mention these specific metrics that were identified in the correct answer. While the additional metrics suggested in the generated answer (like robustness, explainability, adaptability, etc.) might be useful, they don't align with the specific metrics outlined in the correct answer. Since the generated answer is missing these critical pieces of information from the correct answer, it should be marked as incorrect.

The generated answer, while detailed and structured, misses a key element from the correct answer. The correct answer specifically mentions using tags like  and  in combination with chain of thought reasoning where Claude explains its step-by-step thinking process. While the generated answer does discuss using XML tags and breaking down tasks into steps, it doesn't explicitly mention the core concept of using  tags to prompt Claude to show its reasoning process.

The generated answer focuses more on a general methodology of breaking down tasks and using XML tags for structure, rather than the specific combination of XML tags with chain of thought reasoning that the correct answer describes. The correct answer provides a more focused and specific approach about using tags to explicitly prompt Claude's reasoning process.

Additionally, the correct answer provides a specific example of how to prompt Claude ("Before answering, explain your reasoning step-by-step in  tags"), which is a crucial piece of information missing from the generated answer.

Evaluating End-to-End:  14%|█▍        | 14/100 [01:13<08:36,  6.01s/it]

The generated answer is incorrect for several reasons:

1. While it correctly identifies that accuracy, cost, and response time are measured, it fails to provide the specific values that were given in the correct answer (89.01% accuracy, 1.61 seconds for 95th percentile response time, $0.0004 per request).

2. The response time metric is described incorrectly - the correct answer specifically mentions "95th percentile response time" while the generated answer refers to "average time."

3. The cost metric is described differently - the correct answer specifies "cost per request routing" while the generated answer refers to "total cost."

4. The generated answer includes placeholder text ([RESULT_ACCURACY], [RESULT_COST], [RESULT_RESPONSE_TIME]) instead of actual values.

These differences and omissions make the generated answer incomplete and partially incorrect compared to the correct answer.

The Generated Answer is correct as it captures the essential point made in the Correct Answer - that Claude's response with a role-based system prompt produces a more detailed, structured, and actionable financial analysis compared to not having a specific role. In fact, the Generated Answer goes into even more specific detail about how the analysis differs, breaking down concrete examples of the improvements (like flagging CAC concerns and providing strategic recommendations). While it provides more granular details than the Correct Answer, it does not contradict anything in the Correct Answer and maintains the same core message about the role-based prompt leading to more insightful and structured analysis. The key comparison point about the quality difference between role-based and non-role-based responses is preserved in both answers.

The generated answer is incorrect because it misses several key points from the correct answer and provides different guidance. Specifically:

1. The correct answer emphasizes using a SINGLE tool, while the generated answer talks about tools in plural without this key specification.

2. The correct answer mentions explicitly setting tool_choice to instruct the model to use the tool, which is completely missing from the generated answer.

3. The correct answer emphasizes that tool names/descriptions should be from the model's perspective since it will pass the input to the tool - this important perspective consideration is missing from the generated answer.

Instead, the generated answer focuses more on the general process of tool usage and implementation details that weren't part of the core guidance in the correct answer. While some of the implementation details provided might be useful, it misses the specific key points that were identified as critical for getting JSON output using tools.

The generated answer is partially correct but includes additional information that goes beyond what is specified in the correct answer and may not be accurate according to Anthropic's documentation. While it correctly mentions that you can pre-fill Claude's response using the "Assistant" role in messages, it adds several other claims about system prompts, simulating conversations, and max_tokens that aren't mentioned in the correct answer and may not be accurate implementations of the content parameter specifically. The core functionality - using the content parameter with assistant role to pre-fill responses - is present in the generated answer, but it's mixed with other unverified claims. Since we want to be strict about accuracy when dealing with documentation, and the answer includes potential misinformation alongside the correct information, it should be marked as incorrect.

The Generated Answer is missing a critical piece of information that is present in the Correct Answer. While it correctly describes the basic difference between tool_use deltas (partial JSON strings for input field) and text deltas (simple text updates), it fails to mention that tool_use deltas may have delays between streaming events as the model emits one complete key-value pair at a time. This timing/delay characteristic is an important distinction mentioned in the Correct Answer that is completely absent from the Generated Answer. Since this represents a meaningful omission of a key technical detail about how the streaming works, the Generated Answer cannot be considered fully correct.

The Generated Answer captures the key points from the Correct Answer:
1. It correctly identifies voyage-code-2 as the recommended embedding model
2. It correctly states that according to Voyage AI, the model offers 17% better performance compared to alternatives

The only minor difference is that the Generated Answer doesn't mention that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on general-purpose corpora. However, this is a supplementary detail rather than a critical piece of information about the core recommendation and performance comparison. The essential substance about the model recommendation and its 17% performance improvement is accurately conveyed.

Since the Generated Answer maintains the core accuracy of the information without any contradictions, just omitting a non-critical detail, it should be considered correct.

The Generated Answer is partially correct but contains extra information that is not verified by the Correct Answer. The first two points about the multimodal cookbook and API reference documentation match the Correct Answer's substance. However, the third point about a developer community is not mentioned in the Correct Answer and appears to be additional unverified information. While this extra information doesn't directly contradict the Correct Answer, we should be conservative in our evaluation when additional claims are made that aren't supported by the reference answer. Therefore, the Generated Answer cannot be considered fully correct.
false

Evaluating End-to-End:  96%|█████████▌| 96/100 [08:18<00:19,  4.81s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct as it conveys the same essential information as the Correct Answer. Both answers indicate that:

1. You can specify the API key as a parameter when creating a new Anthropic client
2. If no API key is provided, it defaults to using the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable

The Generated Answer actually provides more detail by showing code examples in both Python and TypeScript, but the core information matches the Correct Answer. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and no critical information from the Correct Answer is missing from the Generated Answer.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:  97%|█████████▋| 97/100 [08:22<00:13,  4.60s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It captures the same two key benefits mentioned in the Correct Answer:

1. Both answers mention identifying edge cases where prompts might fail/falter
2. Both answers emphasize ensuring consistent performance across different test inputs/cases

The Generated Answer breaks these points down in a slightly different format but conveys the same core information about using the Evaluation tool to find problematic cases and ensure reliable performance. There are no contradictions between the answers, and no critical information is missing from the Generated Answer compared to the Correct Answer.
true

Evaluating End-to-End:  98%|█████████▊| 98/100 [08:30<00:10,  5.48s/it]

The Generated Answer is incorrect because it misses a crucial element from the Correct Answer. The Correct Answer emphasizes that the key difference is that the pretrained model is not inherently good at following instructions or answering questions, and that specifically RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) was used to create the helpful and safe Claude assistant. While the Generated Answer mentions "finetuning and optimization," it does not capture this fundamental distinction about the model's base capabilities vs its trained behaviors, nor does it specifically mention RLHF. The Generated Answer instead focuses on more technical and operational aspects like API integration, versioning, and customization, which weren't mentioned in the Correct Answer as key differences. The Generated Answer therefore misses the core conceptual difference between the base model and the final assistant.
false

true

Evaluating End-to-End: 100%|██████████| 100/100 [08:37<00:00,  5.18s/it]

The Generated Answer is correct. It identifies the same two methods for specifying the API key as mentioned in the Correct Answer:
1. Using the environment variable ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
2. Passing the API key directly when initializing the client via the api_key parameter

While the Generated Answer is more concise, it captures all the essential information from the Correct Answer. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and no critical information is missing. The differences are merely in phrasing and level of detail, but the core substance is identical.

## Level 3 - Re-Ranking with Claude

In this final enhancement to our retrieval system, we introduce a reranking step to further improve the relevance of the retrieved documents. This approach leverages Claude's power to better understand the context and nuances of both the query and the retrieved documents.

The `rerank_results` function uses Claude to reassess and reorder the initially retrieved documents:

1. It presents Claude with the query and summaries of all retrieved documents.
2. Claude is asked to select and rank the most relevant documents.
3. The function parses Claude's response to get the reranked document indices.
4. It includes fallback mechanisms in case of errors or insufficient results.
5. Finally, it assigns descending relevance scores to the reranked results.

The `retrieve_advanced` function implements the new retrieval pipeline:

1. We initially retrieve more documents than needed (default 20, configurable via `initial_k`) from the vector database.
2. We then use the `rerank_results` function to refine this larger set down to the most relevant documents (default 3, configurable via `k`).
3. Finally, it generates a new context string from these reranked documents.

This process casts a wider net initially and then uses AI to focus on the most pertinent information. By combining vector-based retrieval with LLM reranking, this approach aims to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate responses to user queries.

Our evaluations show significant improvements:

- Accuracy increased from 78% in our previous system to 85%.
- Precision was improved by using our re-ranker to reduce the number of documents shown to the LLM.
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) was likely improved by asking Claude to rank the relevance of each document in order.

These improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating AI-powered reranking in our retrieval process.

While the Correct Answer provides additional context about the Claude iOS app and Claude Team plan, these are supplementary details rather than critical pieces of information about the Prompt Generator capabilities themselves. The Generated Answer accurately conveys the essential functionality and purpose of the new tool, even if it's more concise. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and the key functionality of helping users create customized prompts is preserved in both versions.\

The Generated Answer is correct. It conveys exactly the same information as the Correct Answer - that both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and the Artifacts feature became available on June 20th, 2024. While the wording is slightly different (omitting "both" and having a slightly different sentence structure), the core information and meaning are identical. There are no missing critical details or contradictions between the two answers.\

\
The Generated Answer is correct. Both answers convey the same core information - that to limit Claude's response to a single token, you should use the "max_tokens" parameter set to 1 in the request. The Generated Answer uses slightly different wording by mentioning "request body" instead of just "request," but this is a minor detail that doesn't change the fundamental meaning. Both answers accurately describe how to achieve the desired single-token limitation using the same parameter with the same value.\

\
The Generated Answer is correct. Both answers convey the same core concept that temperature controls randomness in the model's output generation. The Generated Answer simply provides more detail and elaboration about what higher and lower temperatures do specifically, but the fundamental meaning matches the Correct Answer. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and the Generated Answer includes the key concept about randomness control that is present in the Correct Answer. The additional details in the Generated Answer serve to explain the concept further rather than change its meaning.\

\
The Generated Answer is incorrect. While it correctly identifies one way to specify API parameters (adding them as additional arguments after the prompt and model), it misses the second key method mentioned in the Correct Answer - the ability to pass in an API key for a specific cell. Instead, it incorrectly states that CLAUDEMESSAGES is the second method. The CLAUDEMESSAGES function is not mentioned in the Correct Answer at all, making this a significant deviation from the correct information. Since one of the two main methods is completely different from what's specified in the Correct Answer, this constitutes a critical error.\

The Generated Answer captures all the key points from the Correct Answer:\
1. Prefilling with { causes Claude to skip the preamble\
2. Results in direct JSON object output\
3. Makes the response more concise\
4. Makes it easier for programs to parse\
\
While the wording is slightly different, the substance and meaning are identical. The Generated Answer effectively communicates the same information about how prefilling with a curly brace affects Claude's output behavior. There are no missing critical pieces of information or contradictions between the two answers.\

The generated answer is partially correct but contains extra information that is not verified by the correct answer. The first two points about the multimodal cookbook and API reference documentation match the correct answer's substance. However, the third point about the developer community is not mentioned in the correct answer and appears to be additional unverified information. Since this addition doesn't contradict the correct information but rather adds to it, and the core resources (cookbook and API reference) are accurately captured, the generated answer can be considered substantially correct in terms of the key information provided.\

\
The Generated Answer is correct and actually provides more detailed information than the Correct Answer while maintaining the same core information. Both answers convey that:\
\
1. The API key can be specified as a parameter when creating a new Anthropic client\
2. If not provided explicitly, the SDK will default to using the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable\
\
The Generated Answer goes further by providing specific code examples in both Python and TypeScript, but this additional detail doesn't contradict or omit any of the key information from the Correct Answer. The substance of both answers is essentially the same.\

\
The Generated Answer is correct. It captures the same two key benefits mentioned in the Correct Answer:\
\
1. Both answers mention identifying edge cases where prompts might fail/falter\
2. Both answers discuss ensuring consistent performance across test inputs/cases\
\
The Generated Answer breaks these points out more explicitly with numbering, but the core substance is identical to the Correct Answer. The slight differences in wording (e.g., "rate individual results" vs "test case inputs") don't change the fundamental meaning. Both answers emphasize the tool's ability to help identify problems and ensure reliability across different scenarios.\

\
The Generated Answer is correct. It captures the key points from the Correct Answer:\
\
1. It acknowledges that the pretrained model is not inherently good at answering questions or following instructions (matching the Correct Answer)\
\
2. It explains that the final version of Claude went through fine-tuning and RLHF to become more helpful and capable (matching the Correct Answer)\
\
While the Generated Answer provides additional details about biases and capabilities, these don't contradict the Correct Answer - they merely expand upon it. The core message about the transformation from pretrained model to final API version through fine-tuning and RLHF is consistent between both answers.\
\
There are no critical pieces of information from the Correct Answer that are missing from the Generated Answer, nor are there any contradictions between the two.\

The Generated Answer is correct. It captures both key methods for specifying the API key that are mentioned in the Correct Answer:\
1. Using the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable\
2. Passing the API key directly when initializing the client\
\
While the Generated Answer is more concise, it contains the same essential information as the Correct Answer. The additional details in the Correct Answer (like mentioning that the environment variable is used "by default") are supplementary and don't change the core correctness of the Generated Answer. There are no contradictions between the two answers, and no critical information is missing.\

## Evaluation - Going Deeper with Promptfoo\
\
This guide has illustrated the importance of measuring prompt performance empirically when prompt engineering. You can read more about our empirical methodology to prompt engineering here. Using a Jupyter Notebook is a great way to start prompt engineering but as your datasets grow larger and your prompts more numerous it is important to leverage tooling that will scale with you.\
\
In this section of the guide we will explore using Promptfoo an open source LLM evaluation toolkit. To get started head over to the ./evaluation directory and checkout the ./evaluation/README.md.\
\
Promptfoo makes it very easy to build automated test suites that compare different models, hyperparameter choices, and prompts against one another.\
\
As an example, you can run the below cell to see the average performance of Haiku vs 3.5 Sonnet across all of our test cases.\
\
python\
\
```\
import json\
\
import numpy as np\
import pandas as pd\
\
# Load the JSON file\
with open("data/end_to_end_results.json") as f:\
    data = json.load(f)\
\
# Extract the results\
results = data["results"]["results"]\
\
# Create a DataFrame\
df = pd.DataFrame(results)\
\
# Extract provider, prompt, and score information\
df["provider"] = df["provider"].apply(lambda x: x["label"] if isinstance(x, dict) else x)\
df["prompt"] = df["prompt"].apply(lambda x: x["label"] if isinstance(x, dict) else x)\
\
\
# Function to safely extract scores\
def extract_score(x):\
    if isinstance(x, dict) and "score" in x:\
        return x["score"] * 100  # Convert to percentage\
    return np.nan\
\
\
df["score"] = df["gradingResult"].apply(extract_score)\
\
# Group by provider and prompt, then calculate mean scores\
result = df.groupby(["provider", "prompt"])["score"].mean().unstack()\
\
# Fill NaN values with 0\
result = result.fillna(0)\
\
# Calculate the average score across all prompts for each provider\
result["Average"] = result.mean(axis=1)\
\
# Sort the result by the average score\
result = result.sort_values(by="Average", ascending=False)\
\
# Round the results to 2 decimal places\
result = result.round(2)\
# Calculate overall statistics\
overall_average = result["Average"].mean()\
overall_std = result["Average"].std()\
best_provider = result["Average"].idxmax()\
worst_provider = result["Average"].idxmin()\
\
print("\nOverall Statistics:")\
print(f"Best Performing Provider: {best_provider} ({result.loc[best_provider, 'Average']:.2f}%)")\
print(f"Worst Performing Provider: {worst_provider} ({result.loc[worst_provider, 'Average']:.2f}%)")\
```\
\
```\
Overall Statistics:\
Best Performing Provider: 3.5 Sonnet: T-0.0 (85.00%)\
Worst Performing Provider: Haiku: T-0.0 (78.00%)\
```\
