Handling stop reasons

Copy page

When you make a request to the Messages API, Claude's response includes a `stop_reason` field that indicates why the model stopped generating its response. Understanding these values is crucial for building robust applications that handle different response types appropriately.

For details about `stop_reason` in the API response, see the [Messages API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages).

## The stop\_reason field

The `stop_reason` field is part of every successful Messages API response. Unlike errors, which indicate failures in processing your request, `stop_reason` tells you why Claude successfully completed its response generation.

Example response

```
{
  "id": "msg_01234",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [\
    {\
      "type": "text",\
      "text": "Here's the answer to your question..."\
    }\
  ],
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 100,
    "output_tokens": 50
  }
}
```

## Stop reason values

### end\_turn

The most common stop reason. Indicates Claude finished its response naturally.

```
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
if response.stop_reason == "end_turn":
    # Process the complete response
    print(response.content[0].text)
```

#### Empty responses with end\_turn

Sometimes Claude returns an empty response (exactly 2-3 tokens with no content) with `stop_reason: "end_turn"`. This typically happens when Claude interprets that the assistant turn is complete, particularly after tool results.

**Common causes:**

- Adding text blocks immediately after tool results (Claude learns to expect the user to always insert text after tool results, so it ends its turn to follow the pattern)
- Sending Claude's completed response back without adding anything (Claude already decided it's done, so it will remain done)

**How to prevent empty responses:**

```
# INCORRECT: Adding text immediately after tool_result
messages = [\
    {"role": "user", "content": "Calculate the sum of 1234 and 5678"},\
    {\
        "role": "assistant",\
        "content": [\
            {\
                "type": "tool_use",\
                "id": "toolu_123",\
                "name": "calculator",\
                "input": {"operation": "add", "a": 1234, "b": 5678},\
            }\
        ],\
    },\
    {\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": [\
            {"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_123", "content": "6912"},\
            {\
                "type": "text",\
                "text": "Here's the result",  # Don't add text after tool_result\
            },\
        ],\
    },\
]

# CORRECT: Send tool results directly without additional text
messages = [\
    {"role": "user", "content": "Calculate the sum of 1234 and 5678"},\
    {\
        "role": "assistant",\
        "content": [\
            {\
                "type": "tool_use",\
                "id": "toolu_123",\
                "name": "calculator",\
                "input": {"operation": "add", "a": 1234, "b": 5678},\
            }\
        ],\
    },\
    {\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": [\
            {"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_123", "content": "6912"}\
        ],\
    },  # Just the tool_result, no additional text\
]

# If you still get empty responses after fixing the above:
def handle_empty_response(client, messages):
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-6", max_tokens=1024, messages=messages
    )

    # Check if response is empty
    if response.stop_reason == "end_turn" and not response.content:
        # INCORRECT: Don't just retry with the empty response
        # This won't work because Claude already decided it's done

        # CORRECT: Add a continuation prompt in a NEW user message
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Please continue"})

        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6", max_tokens=1024, messages=messages
        )

    return response
```

**Best practices:**

1. **Never add text blocks immediately after tool results** \- This teaches Claude to expect user input after every tool use
2. **Don't retry empty responses without modification** \- Simply sending the empty response back won't help
3. **Use continuation prompts as a last resort** \- Only if the above fixes don't resolve the issue

### max\_tokens

Claude stopped because it reached the `max_tokens` limit specified in your request.

```
# Request with limited tokens
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=10,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum physics"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
    # Response was truncated
    print("Response was cut off at token limit")
    # Consider making another request to continue
```

### stop\_sequence

Claude encountered one of your custom stop sequences.

```
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    stop_sequences=["END", "STOP"],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Generate text until you say END"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "stop_sequence":
    print(f"Stopped at sequence: {response.stop_sequence}")
```

### tool\_use

Claude is calling a tool and expects you to execute it.

For most tool use implementations, we recommend using the [tool runner](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#tool-runner-beta) which automatically handles tool execution, result formatting, and conversation management.

```
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()
weather_tool = {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City and state"},
        },
        "required": ["location"],
    },
}

def execute_tool(name, tool_input):
    """Execute a tool and return the result."""
    return f"Weather in {tool_input.get('location', 'unknown')}: 72°F"

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[weather_tool],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather?"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
    # Extract and execute the tool
    for content in response.content:
        if content.type == "tool_use":
            result = execute_tool(content.name, content.input)
            # Return result to Claude for final response
```

### pause\_turn

Returned when the server-side sampling loop reaches its iteration limit while executing [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#server-tools) like web search or web fetch. The default limit is 10 iterations per request.

When this happens, the response may contain a `server_tool_use` block without a corresponding `server_tool_result`. To let Claude finish processing, continue the conversation by sending the response back as-is.

```
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search"}],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Search for latest AI news"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "pause_turn":
    # Continue the conversation by sending the response back
    messages = [\
        {"role": "user", "content": original_query},\
        {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content},\
    ]
    continuation = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-6",
        messages=messages,
        tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search"}],
    )
```

Your application should handle `pause_turn` in any agent loop that uses server tools. Simply add the assistant's response to your messages array and make another API request to let Claude continue.

### refusal

Claude refused to generate a response due to safety concerns.

```
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "[Unsafe request]"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "refusal":
    # Claude declined to respond
    print("Claude was unable to process this request")
    # Consider rephrasing or modifying the request
```

If you encounter `refusal` stop reasons frequently while using Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.1, you can try updating your API calls to use Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`), which has different usage restrictions. Learn more about [understanding Sonnet 4.5's API safety filters](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12449294-understanding-sonnet-4-5-s-api-safety-filters).

To learn more about refusals triggered by API safety filters for Claude Sonnet 4.5, see [Understanding Sonnet 4.5's API Safety Filters](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12449294-understanding-sonnet-4-5-s-api-safety-filters).

### model\_context\_window\_exceeded

Claude stopped because it reached the model's context window limit. This allows you to request the maximum possible tokens without knowing the exact input size.

```
# Request with maximum tokens to get as much as possible
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=64000,  # Practical non-streaming ceiling (Opus 4.6 supports 128K with streaming)
    messages=[\
        {"role": "user", "content": "Large input that uses most of context window..."}\
    ],
)

if response.stop_reason == "model_context_window_exceeded":
    # Response hit context window limit before max_tokens
    print("Response reached model's context window limit")
    # The response is still valid but was limited by context window
```

This stop reason is available by default in Sonnet 4.5 and newer models. For earlier models, use the beta header `model-context-window-exceeded-2025-08-26` to enable this behavior.

## Best practices for handling stop reasons

### 1\. Always check stop\_reason

Make it a habit to check the `stop_reason` in your response handling logic:

```
def handle_response(response):
    if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
        return handle_tool_use(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
        return handle_truncation(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "model_context_window_exceeded":
        return handle_context_limit(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "pause_turn":
        return handle_pause(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "refusal":
        return handle_refusal(response)
    else:
        # Handle end_turn and other cases
        return response.content[0].text
```

### 2\. Handle truncated responses gracefully

When a response is truncated due to token limits or context window:

```
def handle_truncated_response(response):
    if response.stop_reason in ["max_tokens", "model_context_window_exceeded"]:
        # Option 1: Warn the user about the specific limit
        if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
            message = "[Response truncated due to max_tokens limit]"
        else:
            message = "[Response truncated due to context window limit]"
        return f"{response.content[0].text}\n\n{message}"

        # Option 2: Continue generation
        messages = [\
            {"role": "user", "content": original_prompt},\
            {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content[0].text},\
        ]
        continuation = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6",
            max_tokens=1024,
            messages=messages + [{"role": "user", "content": "Please continue"}],
        )
        return response.content[0].text + continuation.content[0].text
```

### 3\. Implement retry logic for pause\_turn

When using [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#server-tools), the API may return `pause_turn` if the server-side sampling loop reaches its iteration limit (default 10). Handle this by continuing the conversation:

```
def handle_server_tool_conversation(client, user_query, tools, max_continuations=5):
    """
    Handle server tool conversations that may require multiple continuations.

    The server runs a sampling loop when executing server tools. If the loop
    reaches its iteration limit, the API returns pause_turn. Continue the
    conversation by sending the response back to let Claude finish.
    """
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_query}]

    for _ in range(max_continuations):
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6", messages=messages, tools=tools
        )

        if response.stop_reason != "pause_turn":
            # Claude finished processing - return the final response
            return response

        # pause_turn: replace the full message list to maintain alternating roles
        messages = [\
            {"role": "user", "content": user_query},\
            {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content},\
        ]

    # Reached max continuations - return the last response
    return response
```

## Stop reasons vs. errors

It's important to distinguish between `stop_reason` values and actual errors:

### Stop reasons (successful responses)

- Part of the response body
- Indicate why generation stopped normally
- Response contains valid content

### Errors (failed requests)

- HTTP status codes 4xx or 5xx
- Indicate request processing failures
- Response contains error details

```
import anthropic
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

try:
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    )

    # Handle successful response with stop_reason
    if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
        print("Response was truncated")

except anthropic.APIError as e:
    # Handle actual errors
    if e.status_code == 429:
        print("Rate limit exceeded")
    elif e.status_code == 500:
        print("Server error")
```

## Streaming considerations

When using streaming, `stop_reason` is:

- `null` in the initial `message_start` event
- Provided in the `message_delta` event
- Not provided in any other events

```
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "message_delta":
            stop_reason = event.delta.stop_reason
            if stop_reason:
                print(f"Stream ended with: {stop_reason}")
```

## Common patterns

### Handling tool use workflows

**Simpler with tool runner**: The example below shows manual tool handling. For most use cases, the [tool runner](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#tool-runner-beta) automatically handles tool execution with much less code.

```
def complete_tool_workflow(client, user_query, tools):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_query}]

    while True:
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6", messages=messages, tools=tools
        )

        if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
            # Execute tools and continue
            tool_results = execute_tools(response.content)
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
            messages.append({"role": "user", "content": tool_results})
        else:
            # Final response
            return response
```

### Ensuring complete responses

```
def get_complete_response(client, prompt, max_attempts=3):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    full_response = ""

    for _ in range(max_attempts):
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-6", messages=messages, max_tokens=4096
        )

        full_response += response.content[0].text

        if response.stop_reason != "max_tokens":
            break

        # Continue from where it left off
        messages = [\
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},\
            {"role": "assistant", "content": full_response},\
            {"role": "user", "content": "Please continue from where you left off."},\
        ]

    return full_response
```

### Getting maximum tokens without knowing input size

With the `model_context_window_exceeded` stop reason, you can request the maximum possible tokens without calculating input size:

```
def get_max_possible_tokens(client, prompt):
    """
    Get as many tokens as possible within the model's context window
    without needing to calculate input token count
    """
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-6",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        max_tokens=64000,  # Practical non-streaming ceiling (Opus 4.6 supports 128K with streaming)
    )

    if response.stop_reason == "model_context_window_exceeded":
        # Got the maximum possible tokens given input size
        print(
            f"Generated {response.usage.output_tokens} tokens (context limit reached)"
        )
    elif response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
        # Got exactly the requested tokens
        print(f"Generated {response.usage.output_tokens} tokens (max_tokens reached)")
    else:
        # Natural completion
        print(f"Generated {response.usage.output_tokens} tokens (natural completion)")

    return response.content[0].text
```

By properly handling `stop_reason` values, you can build more robust applications that gracefully handle different response scenarios and provide better user experiences.
