Files API

Copy page

The Files API lets you upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without re-uploading content with each request. This is particularly useful when using the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) to provide inputs (e.g. datasets and documents) and then download outputs (e.g. charts). You can also use the Files API to prevent having to continually re-upload frequently used documents and images across multiple API calls. You can [explore the API reference directly](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/files-create), in addition to this guide.

The Files API is in beta. Reach out through the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/tisHyierGwgN4DUE9) to share your experience with the Files API.

This feature is in beta and is **not** eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/zero-data-retention). Beta features are excluded from ZDR.

## Supported models

Referencing a `file_id` in a Messages request is supported in all models that support the given file type. For example, [images](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) are supported in all Claude 3+ models, [PDFs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) in all Claude 3.5+ models, and [various other file types](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#supported-file-types) for the code execution tool in Claude Haiku 4.5 plus all Claude 3.7+ models.

The Files API is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI.

## How the Files API works

The Files API provides a simple create-once, use-many-times approach for working with files:

- **Upload files** to our secure storage and receive a unique `file_id`
- **Download files** that are created from skills or the code execution tool
- **Reference files** in [Messages](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages) requests using the `file_id` instead of re-uploading content
- **Manage your files** with list, retrieve, and delete operations

## How to use the Files API

To use the Files API, you'll need to include the beta feature header: `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`.

### Uploading a file

Upload a file to be referenced in future API calls:

Shell

```
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf"
```

The response from uploading a file will include:

```
{
  "id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w",
  "type": "file",
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "size_bytes": 1024000,
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "downloadable": false
}
```

### Using a file in messages

Once uploaded, reference the file using its `file_id`:

Shell

```
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [\
      {\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": [\
          {\
            "type": "text",\
            "text": "Please summarize this document for me."\
          },\
          {\
            "type": "document",\
            "source": {\
              "type": "file",\
              "file_id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w"\
            }\
          }\
        ]\
      }\
    ]
  }'
```

### File types and content blocks

The Files API supports different file types that correspond to different content block types:

| File Type | MIME Type | Content Block Type | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `document` | Text analysis, document processing |
| Plain text | `text/plain` | `document` | Text analysis, processing |
| Images | `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp` | `image` | Image analysis, visual tasks |
| [Datasets, others](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#supported-file-types) | Varies | `container_upload` | Analyze data, create visualizations |

### Working with other file formats

For file types that are not supported as `document` blocks (.csv, .txt, .md, .docx, .xlsx), convert the files to plain text, and include the content directly in your message:

Shell

```
# Example: Reading a text file and sending it as plain text
# Note: For files with special characters, consider base64 encoding
# ...

curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d @- <<EOF
{
  "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "messages": [\
    {\
      "role": "user",\
      "content": [\
        {\
          "type": "text",\
          "text": "Here's the document content:\n\n${TEXT_CONTENT}\n\nPlease summarize this document."\
        }\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
EOF
```

For .docx files containing images, convert them to PDF format first, then use [PDF support](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) to take advantage of the built-in image parsing. This allows using citations from the PDF document.

#### Document blocks

For PDFs and text files, use the `document` content block:

```
{
  "type": "document",
  "source": {
    "type": "file",
    "file_id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w"
  },
  "title": "Document Title", // Optional
  "context": "Context about the document", // Optional
  "citations": { "enabled": true } // Optional, enables citations
}
```

#### Image blocks

For images, use the `image` content block:

```
{
  "type": "image",
  "source": {
    "type": "file",
    "file_id": "file_011CPMxVD3fHLUhvTqtsQA5w"
  }
}
```

### Managing files

#### List files

Retrieve a list of your uploaded files:

Shell

```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
```

#### Get file metadata

Retrieve information about a specific file:

Shell

```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
```

#### Delete a file

Remove a file from your workspace:

Shell

```
curl -X DELETE https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
```

### Downloading a file

Download files that have been created by skills or the code execution tool:

Shell

```
curl -X GET "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w/content" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  --output downloaded_file.txt
```

You can only download files that were created by [skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide) or the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool). Files that you uploaded cannot be downloaded.

## File storage and limits

### Storage limits

- **Maximum file size:** 500 MB per file
- **Total storage:** 100 GB per organization

### File lifecycle

- Files are scoped to the workspace of the API key. Other API keys can use files created by any other API key associated with the same workspace
- Files persist until you delete them
- Deleted files cannot be recovered
- Files are inaccessible via the API shortly after deletion, but they may persist in active `Messages` API calls and associated tool uses
- Files that users delete will be deleted in accordance with our [data retention policy](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-my-organization-s-data).

* * *

## Error handling

Common errors when using the Files API include:

- **File not found (404):** The specified `file_id` doesn't exist or you don't have access to it
- **Invalid file type (400):** The file type doesn't match the content block type (e.g., using an image file in a document block)
- **Exceeds context window size (400):** The file is larger than the context window size (e.g. using a 500 MB plaintext file in a `/v1/messages` request)
- **Invalid filename (400):** Filename doesn't meet the length requirements (1-255 characters) or contains forbidden characters (`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, `*`, `\`, `/`, or unicode characters 0-31)
- **File too large (413):** File exceeds the 500 MB limit
- **Storage limit exceeded (403):** Your organization has reached the 100 GB storage limit
