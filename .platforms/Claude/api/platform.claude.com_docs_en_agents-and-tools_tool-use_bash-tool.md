Bash tool

Copy page

The bash tool enables Claude to execute shell commands in a persistent bash session, allowing system operations, script execution, and command-line automation. Shell access is a foundational agent capability. On [Terminal-Bench 2.0](https://github.com/terminal-bench/terminal-bench), a benchmark that evaluates real-world terminal tasks using shell-only validation, Claude shows strong performance gains with access to a persistent bash session.

## Overview

The bash tool provides Claude with:

- Persistent bash session that maintains state
- Ability to run any shell command
- Access to environment variables and working directory
- Command chaining and scripting capabilities

## Model compatibility

| Model | Tool Version |
| --- | --- |
| Claude 4 models and Sonnet 3.7 ( [deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)) | `bash_20250124` |

Older tool versions are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with newer models. Always use the tool version that corresponds to your model version.

## Use cases

- **Development workflows:** Run build commands, tests, and development tools
- **System automation:** Execute scripts, manage files, automate tasks
- **Data processing:** Process files, run analysis scripts, manage datasets
- **Environment setup:** Install packages, configure environments

## Quick start

Python

```
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[{"type": "bash_20250124", "name": "bash"}],
    messages=[\
        {"role": "user", "content": "List all Python files in the current directory."}\
    ],
)
```

## How it works

The bash tool maintains a persistent session:

1. Claude determines what command to run
2. You execute the command in a bash shell
3. Return the output (stdout and stderr) to Claude
4. Session state persists between commands (environment variables, working directory)

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | Yes\* | The bash command to run |
| `restart` | No | Set to `true` to restart the bash session |

\*Required unless using `restart`

### Example usage

## Example: Multi-step automation

Claude can chain commands to complete complex tasks:

```
# User request
"Install the requests library and create a simple Python script that fetches a joke from an API, then run it."

# Claude's tool uses:
# 1. Install package
{"command": "pip install requests"}

# 2. Create script
{
    "command": "cat > fetch_joke.py << 'EOF'\nimport requests\nresponse = requests.get('https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke')\njoke = response.json()\nprint(f\"Setup: {joke['setup']}\")\nprint(f\"Punchline: {joke['punchline']}\")\nEOF"
}

# 3. Run script
{"command": "python fetch_joke.py"}
```

The session maintains state between commands, so files created in step 2 are available in step 3.

## Implement the bash tool

The bash tool is implemented as a schema-less tool. When using this tool, you don't need to provide an input schema as with other tools; the schema is built into Claude's model and can't be modified.

1. 1



Set up a bash environment







Create a persistent bash session that Claude can interact with:









```
import subprocess
import threading
import queue


class BashSession:
       def __init__(self):
           self.process = subprocess.Popen(
               ["/bin/bash"],
               stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
               stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
               stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
               text=True,
               bufsize=0,
           )
           self.output_queue = queue.Queue()
           self.error_queue = queue.Queue()
           self._start_readers()
```

2. 2



Handle command execution







Create a function to execute commands and capture output:









```
def execute_command(self, command):
       # Send command to bash
       self.process.stdin.write(command + "\n")
       self.process.stdin.flush()

       # Capture output with timeout
       output = self._read_output(timeout=10)
       return output
```

3. 3



Process Claude's tool calls







Extract and execute commands from Claude's responses:









```
for content in response.content:
       if content.type == "tool_use" and content.name == "bash":
           if content.input.get("restart"):
               bash_session.restart()
               result = "Bash session restarted"
           else:
               command = content.input.get("command")
               result = bash_session.execute_command(command)

           # Return result to Claude
           tool_result = {
               "type": "tool_result",
               "tool_use_id": content.id,
               "content": result,
           }
```

4. 4



Implement safety measures







Add validation and restrictions:









```
def validate_command(command):
       # Block dangerous commands
       dangerous_patterns = ["rm -rf /", "format", ":(){:|:&};:"]
       for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
           if pattern in command:
               return False, f"Command contains dangerous pattern: {pattern}"

       # Add more validation as needed
       return True, None
```


### Handle errors

When implementing the bash tool, handle various error scenarios:

### Command execution timeout

### Command not found

### Permission denied

### Follow implementation best practices

### Use command timeouts

### Maintain session state

### Handle large outputs

### Log all commands

### Sanitize outputs

## Security

The bash tool provides direct system access. Implement these essential safety measures:

- Running in isolated environments (Docker/VM)
- Implementing command filtering and allowlists
- Setting resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
- Logging all executed commands

### Key recommendations

- Use `ulimit` to set resource constraints
- Filter dangerous commands (`sudo`, `rm -rf`, etc.)
- Run with minimal user permissions
- Monitor and log all command execution

## Pricing

The bash tool adds **245 input tokens** to your API calls.

Additional tokens are consumed by:

- Command outputs (stdout/stderr)
- Error messages
- Large file contents

See [tool use pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#pricing) for complete pricing details.

## Common patterns

### Development workflows

- Running tests: `pytest && coverage report`
- Building projects: `npm install && npm run build`
- Git operations: `git status && git add . && git commit -m "message"`

#### Git-based checkpointing

Git serves as a structured recovery mechanism in long-running agent workflows, not just a way to save changes:

- **Capture a baseline:** Before any agent work begins, commit the current state. This is the known-good starting point.
- **Commit per feature:** Each completed feature gets its own commit. These serve as rollback points if something goes wrong later.
- **Reconstruct state at session start:** Read `git log` alongside a progress file to understand what has already been done and what comes next.
- **Revert on failure:** If work goes sideways, `git checkout` reverts to the last good commit instead of trying to debug a broken state.

### File operations

- Processing data: `wc -l *.csv && ls -lh *.csv`
- Searching files: `find . -name "*.py" | xargs grep "pattern"`
- Creating backups: `tar -czf backup.tar.gz ./data`

### System tasks

- Checking resources: `df -h && free -m`
- Process management: `ps aux | grep python`
- Environment setup: `export PATH=$PATH:/new/path && echo $PATH`

## Limitations

- **No interactive commands:** Cannot handle `vim`, `less`, or password prompts
- **No GUI applications:** Command-line only
- **Session scope:** Persists within conversation, lost between API calls
- **Output limits:** Large outputs may be truncated
- **No streaming:** Results returned after completion

## Combining with other tools

The bash tool is most powerful when combined with the [text editor](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool) and other tools.

If you're also using the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool), Claude has access to two separate execution environments: your local bash session and Anthropic's sandboxed container. State is not shared between them. See [Using code execution with other execution tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#using-code-execution-with-other-execution-tools) for guidance on prompting Claude to distinguish between environments.
