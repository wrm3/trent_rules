Claude Code supports customizable keyboard shortcuts. Run `/keybindings` to create or open your configuration file at `~/.claude/keybindings.json`.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#configuration-file)  Configuration file

The keybindings configuration file is an object with a `bindings` array. Each block specifies a context and a map of keystrokes to actions.

Changes to the keybindings file are automatically detected and applied without restarting Claude Code.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$schema` | Optional JSON Schema URL for editor autocompletion |
| `$docs` | Optional documentation URL |
| `bindings` | Array of binding blocks by context |

This example binds `Ctrl+E` to open an external editor in the chat context, and unbinds `Ctrl+U`:

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#keystroke-syntax)  Keystroke syntax

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#modifiers)  Modifiers

Use modifier keys with the `+` separator:

- `ctrl` or `control` \- Control key
- `alt`, `opt`, or `option` \- Alt/Option key
- `shift` \- Shift key
- `meta`, `cmd`, or `command` \- Meta/Command key

For example:

Ask AI

```
ctrl+k          Single key with modifier
shift+tab       Shift + Tab
meta+p          Command/Meta + P
ctrl+shift+c    Multiple modifiers
```

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#uppercase-letters)  Uppercase letters

A standalone uppercase letter implies Shift. For example, `K` is equivalent to `shift+k`. This is useful for vim-style bindings where uppercase and lowercase keys have different meanings.Uppercase letters with modifiers (e.g., `ctrl+K`) are treated as stylistic and do **not** imply Shift — `ctrl+K` is the same as `ctrl+k`.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#chords)  Chords

Chords are sequences of keystrokes separated by spaces:

```
ctrl+k ctrl+s   Press Ctrl+K, release, then Ctrl+S
```

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#special-keys)  Special keys

- `escape` or `esc` \- Escape key
- `enter` or `return` \- Enter key
- `tab` \- Tab key
- `space` \- Space bar
- `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` \- Arrow keys
- `backspace`, `delete` \- Delete keys

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#unbind-default-shortcuts)  Unbind default shortcuts

Set an action to `null` to unbind a default shortcut:

```
{
  "bindings": [\
    {\
      "context": "Chat",\
      "bindings": {\
        "ctrl+s": null\
      }\
    }\
  ]
}
```

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#reserved-shortcuts)  Reserved shortcuts

These shortcuts cannot be rebound:

| Shortcut | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+C | Hardcoded interrupt/cancel |
| Ctrl+D | Hardcoded exit |

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#terminal-conflicts)  Terminal conflicts

Some shortcuts may conflict with terminal multiplexers:

| Shortcut | Conflict |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+B | tmux prefix (press twice to send) |
| Ctrl+A | GNU screen prefix |
| Ctrl+Z | Unix process suspend (SIGTSTP) |

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#vim-mode-interaction)  Vim mode interaction

When vim mode is enabled (`/vim`), keybindings and vim mode operate independently:

- **Vim mode** handles input at the text input level (cursor movement, modes, motions)
- **Keybindings** handle actions at the component level (toggle todos, submit, etc.)
- The Escape key in vim mode switches INSERT to NORMAL mode; it does not trigger `chat:cancel`
- Most Ctrl+key shortcuts pass through vim mode to the keybinding system
- In vim NORMAL mode, `?` shows the help menu (vim behavior)

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/keybindings\#validation)  Validation

Claude Code validates your keybindings and shows warnings for:

- Parse errors (invalid JSON or structure)
- Invalid context names
- Reserved shortcut conflicts
- Terminal multiplexer conflicts
- Duplicate bindings in the same context

Run `/doctor` to see any keybinding warnings.
