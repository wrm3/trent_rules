## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide\#windows)  Windows

Follow these four steps to install Git, set up PowerShell, and start Claude Code on Windows.

1

[Navigate to header](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide#)

Install Git for Windows

Git is a tool that Claude Code uses internally to track changes to your code. You won’t need to learn Git yourself.If you don’t already have it:

1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) and download the installer
2. Run the installer. Click Next on each screen to accept the defaults. The installer has many screens, but you don’t need to change anything.
3. If it asks you to choose an editor, keep the default and click Next.
4. When you see “Adjusting your PATH environment,” keep the recommended option selected.

Already have Git? You can skip this step. If you’re not sure, install it anyway. Reinstalling won’t cause problems.

2

[Navigate to header](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide#)

Open PowerShell

PowerShell is Windows’ built-in terminal for typing commands. It comes pre-installed on every Windows computer.Press `Win + X` and select **Windows PowerShell** (or **Terminal**) from the menu. A window with a blinking cursor will appear. This is where you’ll type commands.

Windows has two command-line programs: PowerShell and CMD. They look similar but use different commands. Make sure you’re in PowerShell for the next step.How to tell which one you’re in:

- **PowerShell**: shows `PS C:\Users\YourName>` at the start of each line
- **CMD**: shows `C:\Users\YourName>` without the `PS`

[Navigate to header](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide#)

Install Claude Code

Copy this line, paste it into PowerShell with `Ctrl + V` or right-click, and press `Enter`:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

This downloads and runs the Claude Code installer. `irm` fetches the file and `iex` runs it. You’ll see text scrolling as it works. When it’s done, you’ll see “Claude Code successfully installed!” If you see an error instead, check the [troubleshooting section](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide#windows-troubleshooting) below.

If you’re in CMD instead of PowerShell, use this command:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

4

[Navigate to header](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide#)

Start Claude Code

Close PowerShell and open a new PowerShell window so it recognizes the newly installed `claude` command. Then type:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude
```

You’ll be prompted to [log in](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication) with your Claude account. Follow the on-screen instructions. A browser window will open for you to sign in.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide\#troubleshooting)  Troubleshooting

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide\#macos-and-linux-troubleshooting)  macOS and Linux troubleshooting

If you run into problems installing on macOS or Linux, check these common issues:

'command not found: claude'

If you see `command not found: claude` after installing, your terminal needs to reload its settings. Close the Terminal window and open a new one, then try `claude` again.If it still doesn’t work, add the install directory to your PATH. Run the command for your shell:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Zsh (macOS default)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Bash (Linux default)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Then try `claude` again. For more details, see [fix your PATH](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#verify-your-path).

Error with HTML code or 'syntax error near unexpected token'

If you see `bash: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token '<'` or HTML code like `<!DOCTYPE html>` in your terminal, the install URL returned a web page instead of the installer script.If the page says “App unavailable in region,” Claude Code is not available in your country. See [supported countries](https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries).Otherwise, try running the command again. If it keeps happening, install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) instead:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
brew install --cask claude-code
```

For other errors, see the full [installation troubleshooting guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#troubleshoot-installation-issues).

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide\#windows-troubleshooting)  Windows troubleshooting

If you run into problems installing on Windows, check these common issues:

'irm is not recognized'

You’re in CMD, not PowerShell. Close this window and open PowerShell instead (`Win + X` then select Windows PowerShell).Alternatively, use the CMD install command:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

SSL/TLS error or 'Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel'

This usually happens on older Windows 10 systems. Run this line first, then retry the install:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

'Claude Code on Windows requires git-bash'

Git for Windows isn’t installed or Claude Code can’t find it.

1. If you haven’t installed Git yet, go back to the [first step in the Windows section](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide#windows).
2. If Git is installed but Claude Code can’t find it, tell it where to look:







Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH="C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```











Then run `claude` again. If your Git is installed somewhere else, find the path by running:







Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
Get-Command git | Select-Object Source
```











Look for the `Git\bin` folder in that path and use it instead.

To make this permanent so you don’t have to set it every time, see [configure Git Bash path](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#windows-claude-code-on-windows-requires-git-bash).

'claude is not recognized'

Restart your computer and try again. This usually fixes the problem.If restarting didn’t help, run these commands to add Claude Code to your PATH:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
$currentPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'User')
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', "$currentPath;$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin", 'User')
```

Close PowerShell, open a new window, and try `claude` again. See [verify your PATH](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#verify-your-path) for more details.

For other errors, see the full [installation troubleshooting guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#troubleshoot-installation-issues).
