If you encounter any issues during installation, see the [troubleshooting guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting).

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#set-up-on-windows)  Set up on Windows

Claude Code on Windows requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) or WSL. You can launch `claude` from PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash. Claude Code uses Git Bash internally to run commands. You do not need to run PowerShell as Administrator.**Option 1: Native Windows with Git Bash**Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win), then run the install command from PowerShell or CMD.If Claude Code can’t find your Git Bash installation, set the path in your [settings.json file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
  }
}
```

**Option 2: WSL**Both WSL 1 and WSL 2 are supported. WSL 2 supports [sandboxing](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing) for enhanced security. WSL 1 does not support sandboxing.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#alpine-linux-and-musl-based-distributions)  Alpine Linux and musl-based distributions

The native installer on Alpine and other musl/uClibc-based distributions requires `libgcc`, `libstdc++`, and `ripgrep`. Install these using your distribution’s package manager, then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0`.This example installs the required packages on Alpine:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
apk add libgcc libstdc++ ripgrep
```

Then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP` to `0` in your [settings.json file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "env": {
    "USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP": "0"
  }
}
```

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#verify-your-installation)  Verify your installation

After installing, confirm Claude Code is working:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --version
```

For a more detailed check of your installation and configuration, run [`claude doctor`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#get-more-help):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude doctor
```

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#authenticate)  Authenticate

Claude Code requires a Pro, Max, Teams, Enterprise, or Console account. The free Claude.ai plan does not include Claude Code access. You can also use Claude Code with a third-party API provider like [Amazon Bedrock](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Vertex AI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/microsoft-foundry).After installing, log in by running `claude` and following the browser prompts. See [Authentication](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication) for all account types and team setup options.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#update-claude-code)  Update Claude Code

Native installations automatically update in the background. You can [configure the release channel](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup#configure-release-channel) to control whether you receive updates immediately or on a delayed stable schedule, or [disable auto-updates](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup#disable-auto-updates) entirely. Homebrew and WinGet installations require manual updates.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#auto-updates)  Auto-updates

Claude Code checks for updates on startup and periodically while running. Updates download and install in the background, then take effect the next time you start Claude Code.

Homebrew and WinGet installations do not auto-update. Use `brew upgrade claude-code` or `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` to update manually.**Known issue:** Claude Code may notify you of updates before the new version is available in these package managers. If an upgrade fails, wait and try again later.Homebrew keeps old versions on disk after upgrades. Run `brew cleanup claude-code` periodically to reclaim disk space.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#configure-release-channel)  Configure release channel

Control which release channel Claude Code follows for auto-updates and `claude update` with the `autoUpdatesChannel` setting:

- `"latest"`, the default: receive new features as soon as they’re released
- `"stable"`: use a version that is typically about one week old, skipping releases with major regressions

Configure this via `/config` → **Auto-update channel**, or add it to your [settings.json file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "autoUpdatesChannel": "stable"
}
```

For enterprise deployments, you can enforce a consistent release channel across your organization using [managed settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#managed-settings).

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#disable-auto-updates)  Disable auto-updates

Set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` to `"1"` in the `env` key of your [settings.json file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
```

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#update-manually)  Update manually

To apply an update immediately without waiting for the next background check, run:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude update
```

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#advanced-installation-options)  Advanced installation options

These options are for version pinning, migrating from npm, and verifying binary integrity.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#install-a-specific-version)  Install a specific version

The native installer accepts either a specific version number or a release channel (`latest` or `stable`). The channel you choose at install time becomes your default for auto-updates.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#deprecated-npm-installation)  Deprecated npm installation

npm installation is deprecated. The native installer is faster, requires no dependencies, and auto-updates in the background. Use the [native installation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup#install-claude-code) method when possible.

#### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#migrate-from-npm-to-native)  Migrate from npm to native

If you previously installed Claude Code with npm, switch to the native installer:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Install the native binary
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Remove the old npm installation
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

You can also run `claude install` from an existing npm installation to install the native binary alongside it, then remove the npm version.

#### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#install-with-npm)  Install with npm

If you need npm installation for compatibility reasons, you must have [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. Install the package globally:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Do NOT use `sudo npm install -g` as this can lead to permission issues and security risks. If you encounter permission errors, see [troubleshooting permission errors](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#permission-errors-during-installation).

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup\#binary-integrity-and-code-signing)  Binary integrity and code signing

You can verify the integrity of Claude Code binaries using SHA256 checksums and code signatures.
