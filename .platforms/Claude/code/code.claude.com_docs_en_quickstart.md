This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in a few minutes. By the end, you’ll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#before-you-begin)  Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open
  - If you’ve never used the terminal before, check out the [terminal guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide)
- A code project to work with
- A [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing) (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise), [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account, or access through a [supported cloud provider](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/third-party-integrations)

This guide covers the terminal CLI. Claude Code is also available on the [web](https://claude.ai/code), as a [desktop app](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop), in [VS Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code) and [JetBrains IDEs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/jetbrains), in [Slack](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slack), and in CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/github-actions) and [GitLab](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd). See [all interfaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview#use-claude-code-everywhere).

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-1-install-claude-code)  Step 1: Install Claude Code

To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

- Native Install (Recommended)

- Homebrew

- WinGet


**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

**Windows requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).** Install it first if you don’t have it.

Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run `brew upgrade claude-code` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-2-log-in-to-your-account)  Step 2: Log in to your account

Claude Code requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `claude` command, you’ll need to log in:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
/login
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
```

You can log in using any of these account types:

- [Claude Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise](https://claude.com/pricing) (recommended)
- [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) (API access with pre-paid credits). On first login, a “Claude Code” workspace is automatically created in the Console for centralized cost tracking.
- [Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/third-party-integrations) (enterprise cloud providers)

Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won’t need to log in again. To switch accounts later, use the `/login` command.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-3-start-your-first-session)  Step 3: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You’ll see the Claude Code welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands or `/resume` to continue a previous conversation.

After logging in (Step 2), your credentials are stored on your system. Learn more in [Credential Management](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#credential-management).

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-4-ask-your-first-question)  Step 4: Ask your first question

Let’s start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
what technologies does this project use?
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
where is the main entry point?
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
explain the folder structure
```

You can also ask Claude about its own capabilities:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
what can Claude Code do?
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
how do I create custom skills in Claude Code?
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
can Claude Code work with Docker?
```

Claude Code reads your project files as needed. You don’t have to manually add context.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-5-make-your-first-code-change)  Step 5: Make your first code change

Now let’s make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable “Accept all” mode for a session.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-6-use-git-with-claude-code)  Step 6: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
what files have I changed?
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
show me the last 5 commits
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-7-fix-a-bug-or-add-a-feature)  Step 7: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.Describe what you want in natural language:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart\#step-8-test-out-other-common-workflows)  Step 8: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:**Refactor code**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
review my changes and suggest improvements
```

Talk to Claude like you would a helpful colleague. Describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.
