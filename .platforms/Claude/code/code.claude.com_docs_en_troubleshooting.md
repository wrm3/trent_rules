## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#debug-installation-problems)  Debug installation problems

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#check-network-connectivity)  Check network connectivity

The installer downloads from `storage.googleapis.com`. Verify you can reach it:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
curl -sI https://storage.googleapis.com
```

If this fails, your network may be blocking the connection. Common causes:

- Corporate firewalls or proxies blocking Google Cloud Storage
- Regional network restrictions: try a VPN or alternative network
- TLS/SSL issues: update your system’s CA certificates, or check if `HTTPS_PROXY` is configured

If you’re behind a corporate proxy, set `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY` to your proxy’s address before installing. Ask your IT team for the proxy URL if you don’t know it, or check your browser’s proxy settings.This example sets both proxy variables, then runs the installer through your proxy:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#verify-your-path)  Verify your PATH

If installation succeeded but you get a `command not found` or `not recognized` error when running `claude`, the install directory isn’t in your PATH. Your shell searches for programs in directories listed in PATH, and the installer places `claude` at `~/.local/bin/claude` on macOS/Linux or `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\claude.exe` on Windows.Check if the install directory is in your PATH by listing your PATH entries and filtering for `local/bin`:

- macOS/Linux

- Windows PowerShell

- Windows CMD


Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep local/bin
```

If there’s no output, the directory is missing. Add it to your shell configuration:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Zsh (macOS default)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Bash (Linux default)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Alternatively, close and reopen your terminal.Verify the fix worked:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --version
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
$env:PATH -split ';' | Select-String 'local\\bin'
```

If there’s no output, add the install directory to your User PATH:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
$currentPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', 'User')
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PATH', "$currentPath;$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin", 'User')
```

Restart your terminal for the change to take effect.Verify the fix worked:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --version
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
echo %PATH% | findstr /i "local\bin"
```

If there’s no output, open System Settings, go to Environment Variables, and add `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` to your User PATH variable. Restart your terminal.Verify the fix worked:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --version
```

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#check-for-conflicting-installations)  Check for conflicting installations

Multiple Claude Code installations can cause version mismatches or unexpected behavior. Check what’s installed:

- macOS/Linux

- Windows PowerShell


List all `claude` binaries found in your PATH:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
which -a claude
```

Check whether the native installer and npm versions are present:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
ls -la ~/.local/bin/claude
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
ls -la ~/.claude/local/
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
npm -g ls @anthropic-ai/claude-code 2>/dev/null
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
where.exe claude
Test-Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Claude Code\claude.exe"
```

If you find multiple installations, keep only one. The native install at `~/.local/bin/claude` is recommended. Remove any extra installations:Uninstall an npm global install:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Remove a Homebrew install on macOS:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
brew uninstall --cask claude-code
```

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#check-directory-permissions)  Check directory permissions

The installer needs write access to `~/.local/bin/` and `~/.claude/`. If installation fails with permission errors, check whether these directories are writable:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
test -w ~/.local/bin && echo "writable" || echo "not writable"
test -w ~/.claude && echo "writable" || echo "not writable"
```

If either directory isn’t writable, create the install directory and set your user as the owner:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
sudo mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.local
```

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#verify-the-binary-works)  Verify the binary works

If `claude` is installed but crashes or hangs on startup, run these checks to narrow down the cause.Confirm the binary exists and is executable:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
ls -la $(which claude)
```

On Linux, check for missing shared libraries. If `ldd` shows missing libraries, you may need to install system packages. On Alpine Linux and other musl-based distributions, see [Alpine Linux setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup#alpine-linux-and-musl-based-distributions).

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
ldd $(which claude) | grep "not found"
```

Run a quick sanity check that the binary can execute:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --version
```

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#common-installation-issues)  Common installation issues

These are the most frequently encountered installation problems and their solutions.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#install-script-returns-html-instead-of-a-shell-script)  Install script returns HTML instead of a shell script

When running the install command, you may see one of these errors:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
bash: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `<'
bash: line 1: `<!DOCTYPE html>'
```

On PowerShell, the same problem appears as:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
Invoke-Expression: Missing argument in parameter list.
```

This means the install URL returned an HTML page instead of the install script. If the HTML page says “App unavailable in region,” Claude Code is not available in your country. See [supported countries](https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries).Otherwise, this can happen due to network issues, regional routing, or a temporary service disruption.**Solutions:**

1. **Use an alternative install method**:On macOS or Linux, install via Homebrew:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
brew install --cask claude-code
```










On Windows, install via WinGet:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

2. **Retry after a few minutes**: the issue is often temporary. Wait and try the original command again.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#command-not-found-claude-after-installation)  `command not found: claude` after installation

The install finished but `claude` doesn’t work. The exact error varies by platform:

| Platform | Error message |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `zsh: command not found: claude` |
| Linux | `bash: claude: command not found` |
| Windows CMD | `'claude' is not recognized as an internal or external command` |
| PowerShell | `claude : The term 'claude' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet` |

This means the install directory isn’t in your shell’s search path. See [Verify your PATH](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting#verify-your-path) for the fix on each platform.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#curl-56-failure-writing-output-to-destination)  `curl: (56) Failure writing output to destination`

The `curl ... | bash` command downloads the script and passes it directly to Bash for execution using a pipe (`|`). This error means the connection broke before the script finished downloading. Common causes include network interruptions, the download being blocked mid-stream, or system resource limits.**Solutions:**

1. **Check network stability**: Claude Code binaries are hosted on Google Cloud Storage. Test that you can reach it:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
curl -fsSL https://storage.googleapis.com -o /dev/null
```










If the command completes silently, your connection is fine and the issue is likely intermittent. Retry the install command. If you see an error, your network may be blocking the download.
2. **Try an alternative install method**:On macOS or Linux:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
brew install --cask claude-code
```










On Windows:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```


### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#tls-or-ssl-connection-errors)  TLS or SSL connection errors

Errors like `curl: (35) TLS connect error`, `schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed`, or PowerShell’s `Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel` indicate TLS handshake failures.**Solutions:**

1. **Update your system CA certificates**:On Ubuntu/Debian:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
```










On macOS via Homebrew:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
brew install ca-certificates
```

2. **On Windows, enable TLS 1.2** in PowerShell before running the installer:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

3. **Check for proxy or firewall interference**: corporate proxies that perform TLS inspection can cause these errors, including `unable to get local issuer certificate`. Set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to your corporate CA certificate bundle:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/corporate-ca.pem
```










Ask your IT team for the certificate file if you don’t have it. You can also try on a direct connection to confirm the proxy is the cause.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#failed-to-fetch-version-from-storage-googleapis-com)  `Failed to fetch version from storage.googleapis.com`

The installer couldn’t reach the download server. This typically means `storage.googleapis.com` is blocked on your network.**Solutions:**

1. **Test connectivity directly**:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
curl -sI https://storage.googleapis.com
```

2. **If behind a proxy**, set `HTTPS_PROXY` so the installer can route through it. See [proxy configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/network-config#proxy-configuration) for details.






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#windows-irm-or-&&-not-recognized)  Windows: `irm` or `&&` not recognized

If you see `'irm' is not recognized` or `The token '&&' is not valid`, you’re running the wrong command for your shell.

- **`irm` not recognized**: you’re in CMD, not PowerShell. You have two options:Open PowerShell by searching for “PowerShell” in the Start menu, then run the original install command:

```

The Linux OOM killer terminated the process because the system ran out of memory. Claude Code requires at least 4 GB of available RAM.**Solutions:**

1. **Add swap space** if your server has limited RAM. Swap uses disk space as overflow memory, letting the install complete even with low physical RAM.Create a 2 GB swap file and enable it:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile

Copy







Ask AI











```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

2. **Close other processes** to free memory before installing.
3. **Use a larger instance** if possible. Claude Code requires at least 4 GB of RAM.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#install-hangs-in-docker)  Install hangs in Docker

When installing Claude Code in a Docker container, installing as root into `/` can cause hangs.**Solutions:**

1. **Set a working directory** before running the installer. When run from `/`, the installer scans the entire filesystem, which causes excessive memory usage. Setting `WORKDIR` limits the scan to a small directory:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
WORKDIR /tmp
RUN curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

2. **Increase Docker memory limits** if using Docker Desktop:

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#windows-claude-desktop-overrides-claude-cli-command)  Windows: Claude Desktop overrides `claude` CLI command

If you installed an older version of Claude Desktop, it may register a `Claude.exe` in the `WindowsApps` directory that takes PATH priority over Claude Code CLI. Running `claude` opens the Desktop app instead of the CLI.Update Claude Desktop to the latest version to fix this issue.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#windows-%E2%80%9Cclaude-code-on-windows-requires-git-bash%E2%80%9D)  Windows: “Claude Code on Windows requires git-bash”

Claude Code on native Windows needs [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win), which includes Git Bash.**If Git is not installed**, download and install it from [git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). During setup, select “Add to PATH.” Restart your terminal after installing.**If Git is already installed** but Claude Code still can’t find it, set the path in your [settings.json file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
  }
}
```

If your Git is installed somewhere else, find the path by running `where.exe git` in PowerShell and use the `bin\bash.exe` path from that directory.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#linux-wrong-binary-variant-installed-musl/glibc-mismatch)  Linux: wrong binary variant installed (musl/glibc mismatch)

If you see errors about missing shared libraries like `libstdc++.so.6` or `libgcc_s.so.1` after installation, the installer may have downloaded the wrong binary variant for your system.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
Error loading shared library libstdc++.so.6: No such file or directory
```

This can happen on glibc-based systems that have musl cross-compilation packages installed, causing the installer to misdetect the system as musl.**Solutions:**

1. **Check which libc your system uses**:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
ldd /bin/ls | head -1
```










If it shows `linux-vdso.so` or references to `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`, you’re on glibc. If it shows `musl`, you’re on musl.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#windows-installation-issues-errors-in-wsl)  Windows installation issues: errors in WSL

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:**OS/platform detection issues**: if you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

- Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
- Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check`. Do not use `sudo`.

**Node not found errors**: if you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution’s package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).**nvm version conflicts**: if you have nvm installed in both WSL and Windows, you may experience version conflicts when switching Node versions in WSL. This happens because WSL imports the Windows PATH by default, causing Windows nvm/npm to take priority over the WSL installation.You can identify this issue by:

- Running `which npm` and `which node` \- if they point to Windows paths (starting with `/mnt/c/`), Windows versions are being used
- Experiencing broken functionality after switching Node versions with nvm in WSL

To resolve this issue, fix your Linux PATH to ensure the Linux node/npm versions take priority:**Primary solution: Ensure nvm is properly loaded in your shell**The most common cause is that nvm isn’t loaded in non-interactive shells. Add the following to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
# Load nvm if it exists
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

Or run directly in your current session:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

**Alternative: Adjust PATH order**If nvm is properly loaded but Windows paths still take priority, you can explicitly prepend your Linux paths to PATH in your shell configuration:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/$(node -v)/bin:$PATH"
```

Avoid disabling Windows PATH importing via `appendWindowsPath = false` as this breaks the ability to call Windows executables from WSL. Similarly, avoid uninstalling Node.js from Windows if you use it for Windows development.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#wsl2-sandbox-setup)  WSL2 sandbox setup

[Sandboxing](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing) is supported on WSL2 but requires installing additional packages. If you see an error like “Sandbox requires socat and bubblewrap” when running `/sandbox`, install the dependencies:

- Ubuntu/Debian

- Fedora


Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
sudo apt-get install bubblewrap socat
```

Report incorrect code

Copy

WSL1 does not support sandboxing. If you see “Sandboxing requires WSL2”, you need to upgrade to WSL2 or run Claude Code without sandboxing.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#permission-errors-during-installation)  Permission errors during installation

If the native installer fails with permission errors, the target directory may not be writable.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#configuration-file-locations)  Configuration file locations

Claude Code stores configuration in several locations:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | User settings (permissions, hooks, model overrides) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Project settings (checked into source control) |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Local project settings (not committed) |
| `~/.claude.json` | Global state (theme, OAuth, MCP servers) |
| `.mcp.json` | Project MCP servers (checked into source control) |

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#slow-or-incomplete-search-results-on-wsl)  Slow or incomplete search results on WSL

Disk read performance penalties when [working across file systems on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems) may result in fewer-than-expected matches when using Claude Code on WSL. Search still functions, but returns fewer results than on a native filesystem.

`/doctor` will show Search as OK in this case.

**Solutions:**

1. **Submit more specific searches**: reduce the number of files searched by specifying directories or file types: “Search for JWT validation logic in the auth-service package” or “Find use of md5 hash in JS files”.
2. **Move project to Linux filesystem**: if possible, ensure your project is located on the Linux filesystem (`/home/`) rather than the Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/`).
3. **Use native Windows instead**: consider running Claude Code natively on Windows instead of through WSL, for better file system performance.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#ide-integration-issues)  IDE integration issues

If Claude Code does not connect to your IDE or behaves unexpectedly within an IDE terminal, try the solutions below.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#jetbrains-ide-not-detected-on-wsl2)  JetBrains IDE not detected on WSL2

If you’re using Claude Code on WSL2 with JetBrains IDEs and getting “No available IDEs detected” errors, this is likely due to WSL2’s networking configuration or Windows Firewall blocking the connection.

#### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#wsl2-networking-modes)  WSL2 networking modes

WSL2 uses NAT networking by default, which can prevent IDE detection. You have two options:**Option 1: Configure Windows Firewall** (recommended)

1. Find your WSL2 IP address:






Report incorrect code







Copy







Ask AI











```
wsl hostname -I
# Example output: 172.21.123.45
```

2. Open PowerShell as Administrator and create a firewall rule:

Ask AI











```
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow WSL2 Internal Traffic" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -RemoteAddress 172.21.0.0/16 -LocalAddress 172.21.0.0/16
```










Adjust the IP range based on your WSL2 subnet from step 1.
3. Restart both your IDE and Claude Code

**Option 2: Switch to mirrored networking**Add to `.wslconfig` in your Windows user directory:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

Then restart WSL with `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell.

These networking issues only affect WSL2. WSL1 uses the host’s network directly and doesn’t require these configurations.

For additional JetBrains configuration tips, see the [JetBrains IDE guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/jetbrains#plugin-settings).

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#report-windows-ide-integration-issues)  Report Windows IDE integration issues

If you’re experiencing IDE integration problems on Windows, [create an issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues) with the following information:

- Environment type: native Windows (Git Bash) or WSL1/WSL2
- WSL networking mode, if applicable: NAT or mirrored
- IDE name and version
- Claude Code extension/plugin version
- Shell type: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#escape-key-not-working-in-jetbrains-ide-terminals)  Escape key not working in JetBrains IDE terminals

If you’re using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the `Esc` key doesn’t interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains’ default shortcuts.To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Either:
   - Uncheck “Move focus to the editor with Escape”, or
   - Click “Configure terminal keybindings” and delete the “Switch focus to Editor” shortcut
3. Apply the changes

This allows the `Esc` key to properly interrupt Claude Code operations.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#markdown-formatting-issues)  Markdown formatting issues

Claude Code sometimes generates markdown files with missing language tags on code fences, which can affect syntax highlighting and readability in GitHub, editors, and documentation tools.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#missing-language-tags-in-code-blocks)  Missing language tags in code blocks

If you notice code blocks like this in generated markdown:

}
```text
````

Instead of properly tagged blocks like:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

````
```javascript
function example() {
return "hello";
}
```text
````

**Solutions:**

1. **Ask Claude to add language tags**: request “Add appropriate language tags to all code blocks in this markdown file.”
2. **Use post-processing hooks**: set up automatic formatting hooks to detect and add missing language tags. See [Auto-format code after edits](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide#auto-format-code-after-edits) for an example of a PostToolUse formatting hook.
3. **Manual verification**: after generating markdown files, review them for proper code block formatting and request corrections if needed.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#inconsistent-spacing-and-formatting)  Inconsistent spacing and formatting

If generated markdown has excessive blank lines or inconsistent spacing:**Solutions:**

1. **Request formatting corrections**: ask Claude to “Fix spacing and formatting issues in this markdown file.”
2. **Use formatting tools**: set up hooks to run markdown formatters like `prettier` or custom formatting scripts on generated markdown files.
3. **Specify formatting preferences**: include formatting requirements in your prompts or project [memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory) files.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting\#reduce-markdown-formatting-issues)  Reduce markdown formatting issues

To minimize formatting issues:

- **Be explicit in requests**: ask for “properly formatted markdown with language-tagged code blocks”
- **Use project conventions**: document your preferred markdown style in [`CLAUDE.md`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)
- **Set up validation hooks**: use post-processing hooks to automatically verify and fix common formatting issues
