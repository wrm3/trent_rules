# Getting started - how to pass images into Claude

The Claude 3 model family supports image inputs in the API. Here’s how you can pass images to Claude:

python

```
%pip install anthropic IPython
```

python

```
from IPython.display import Image

Image(filename="../images/sunset.jpeg")
```

![Output image](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/images/notebooks/multimodal-getting-started-with-vision/multimodal-getting-started-with-vision_cell2_out0_fe5c0f12.jpeg)

python

```
import base64

from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()
MODEL_NAME = "claude-opus-4-1"

with open("../images/sunset.jpeg", "rb") as image_file:
    binary_data = image_file.read()
    base_64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(binary_data)
    base64_string = base_64_encoded_data.decode("utf-8")


message_list = [\
    {\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": [\
            {\
                "type": "image",\
                "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "image/jpeg", "data": base64_string},\
            },\
            {"type": "text", "text": "Write a sonnet based on this image."},\
        ],\
    }\
]

response = client.messages.create(model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=2048, messages=message_list)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

```
Upon the rocky shore, a beacon bright,
Its steadfast light a guide through darkest night.
While sun descends in hues of pink and red,
The lighthouse stands, a stalwart figure head.

The waves crash 'gainst the weathered stone below,
A ceaseless rhythm, ancient ebb and flow.
Yet still the tower remains, resolute,
A guardian watching, ever vigilant mute.

The vast expanse of sea and sky surround,
Horizon's line where heaven meets the ground.
This timeless scene, a testament to might,
Of nature's power and the human fight.

The lighthouse, proud amid the fading day,
Eternal symbol, showing safe the way.
```

## Passing an image through a url

If you only have a URL of the image you can still pass it to Claude with just a few short lines of code.

python

```
IMAGE_URL = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Machu_Picchu%2C_Peru_%282018%29.jpg/2560px-Machu_Picchu%2C_Peru_%282018%29.jpg"
Image(url=IMAGE_URL)
```

```

```

python

```
import httpx

IMAGE_DATA = base64.b64encode(httpx.get(IMAGE_URL).content).decode("utf-8")

message_list = [\
    {\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": [\
            {\
                "type": "image",\
                "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "image/jpeg", "data": IMAGE_DATA},\
            },\
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image in two sentences."},\
        ],\
    }\
]

response = client.messages.create(model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=2048, messages=message_list)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

```
The image depicts the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu, perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru. The well-preserved stone ruins, including terraces, plazas, and buildings, are set against a stunning backdrop of steep, verdant mountains under a partly cloudy sky.
