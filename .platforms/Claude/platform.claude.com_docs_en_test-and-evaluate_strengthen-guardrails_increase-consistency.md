Increase output consistency

**For guaranteed JSON schema conformance**

If you need Claude to always output valid JSON that conforms to a specific schema, use [Structured Outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) instead of the prompt engineering techniques below. Structured outputs provide guaranteed schema compliance and are specifically designed for this use case.

The techniques below are useful for general output consistency or when you need flexibility beyond strict JSON schemas.

Here's how to make Claude's responses more consistent:

## Specify the desired output format

Precisely define your desired output format using JSON, XML, or custom templates so that Claude understands every output formatting element you require.

### Example: Standardizing customer feedback

## Prefill Claude's response

Prefilling is deprecated and not supported on Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, and Claude Sonnet 4.5. Use [structured outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) or system prompt instructions instead.

Prefill the `Assistant` turn with your desired format. This trick bypasses Claude's friendly preamble and enforces your structure.

### Example: Daily sales report

## Constrain with examples

Provide examples of your desired output. This trains Claude's understanding better than abstract instructions.

### Example: Generating consistent market intelligence

## Use retrieval for contextual consistency

For tasks requiring consistent context (e.g., chatbots, knowledge bases), use retrieval to ground Claude's responses in a fixed information set.

### Example: Enhancing IT support consistency

## Chain prompts for complex tasks

Break down complex tasks into smaller, consistent subtasks. Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing inconsistency errors across scaled workflows.

## Keep Claude in character

For role-based applications, maintaining consistent character requires deliberate prompting.

- **Use system prompts to set the role:** Use [system prompts](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role) to define Claude's role and personality. This sets a strong foundation for consistent responses.











When setting up the character, provide detailed information about the personality, background, and any specific traits or quirks. This will help the model better emulate and generalize the character's traits.

- **Prepare Claude for possible scenarios:** Provide a list of common scenarios and expected responses in your prompts. This "trains" Claude to handle diverse situations without breaking character.

### Example: Enterprise chatbot for role prompting
