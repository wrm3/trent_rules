# MCP

## [Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#overview)

The Cursor CLI supports [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp) servers, allowing you to connect external tools and data sources to `agent`. **MCP in the CLI uses the same configuration as the editor** \- any MCP servers you've configured will work with both.

## [CLI commands](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#cli-commands)

Use the `agent mcp` command to manage MCP servers

### [List configured servers](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#list-configured-servers)

View all configured MCP servers and their current status:

```
agent mcp list
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can browse, enable, and configure MCP servers at a glance. The list shows:

- Server names and identifiers
- Connection status (connected/disconnected)
- Configuration source (project or global)
- Transport method (stdio, HTTP, SSE)

You can also use the `/mcp list` slash command in interactive mode for the same interface.

### [List available tools](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#list-available-tools)

View tools provided by a specific MCP server:

```
agent mcp list-tools <identifier>
```

This displays:

- Tool names and descriptions
- Required and optional parameters
- Parameter types and constraints

### [Login to MCP server](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#login-to-mcp-server)

Authenticate with an MCP server configured in your `mcp.json`:

```
agent mcp login <identifier>
```

The CLI uses a streamlined login flow with automatic callback handling. The agent gets access to authenticated MCPs immediately after login completes.

### [Enable MCP server](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#enable-mcp-server)

Enable an MCP server:

```
agent mcp enable <identifier>
```

You can also use the `/mcp enable <name>` slash command in interactive mode.

### [Disable MCP server](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#disable-mcp-server)

Disable an MCP server:

```
agent mcp disable <identifier>
```

You can also use the `/mcp disable <name>` slash command in interactive mode.

MCP server names with spaces are supported in all `/mcp` commands.

## [Using MCP with Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#using-mcp-with-agent)

Once you have MCP servers configured (see the [main MCP guide](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp) for setup), `agent` automatically discovers and uses available tools when relevant to your requests.

```
# Check what MCP servers are available
agent mcp list

# See what tools a specific server provides
agent mcp list-tools playwright

# Use agent - it automatically uses MCP tools when helpful
agent -p "Navigate to google.com and take a screenshot of the search page"

# Auto-approve all MCP servers (skip approval prompts)
agent --approve-mcps "query my database for recent errors"
```

The CLI follows the same configuration precedence as the editor (project → global → nested), automatically discovering configurations from parent directories.

## [MCP vs ACP](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/mcp\#mcp-vs-acp)

Use MCP when you want Cursor to call external tools and services. Use [ACP](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/acp) when you want to build a custom client that talks to Cursor CLI itself over protocol messages.
