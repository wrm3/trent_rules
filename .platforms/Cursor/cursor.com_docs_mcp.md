### [Why use MCP?](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#why-use-mcp)

MCP connects Cursor to external systems and data. Instead of explaining your project structure repeatedly, integrate directly with your tools.

Write MCP servers in any language that can print to `stdout` or serve an HTTP endpoint - Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.

### [How it works](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#how-it-works)

MCP servers expose capabilities through the protocol, connecting Cursor to external tools or data sources.

Cursor supports three transport methods:

| Transport | Execution environment | Deployment | Users | Input | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`stdio`** | Local | Cursor manages | Single user | Shell command | Manual |
| **`SSE`** | Local/Remote | Deploy as server | Multiple users | URL to an SSE endpoint | OAuth |
| **`Streamable HTTP`** | Local/Remote | Deploy as server | Multiple users | URL to an HTTP endpoint | OAuth |

### [Protocol and extension support](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#protocol-and-extension-support)

Cursor supports these MCP protocol capabilities and extensions:

| Feature | Support | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tools** | Supported | Functions for the AI model to execute |
| **Prompts** | Supported | Templated messages and workflows for users |
| **Resources** | Supported | Structured data sources that can be read and referenced |
| **Roots** | Supported | Server-initiated inquiries into URI or filesystem boundaries |
| **Elicitation** | Supported | Server-initiated requests for additional information from users |
| **Apps (extension)** | Supported | Interactive UI views returned by MCP tools |

### [MCP apps](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#mcp-apps)

Cursor supports the [MCP Apps extension](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview). MCP tools can return interactive UI along with standard tool output.

MCP Apps follow progressive enhancement. If a host cannot render app UI, the same tool still works through normal MCP responses.

## [Installing MCP servers](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#installing-mcp-servers)

### [One-click installation](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#one-click-installation)

Browse and install MCP servers from the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace). Click "Add to Cursor" on any server to install it and authenticate with OAuth.

### [Using `mcp.json`](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#using-mcpjson)

Configure custom MCP servers with a JSON file:

CLI Server - Node.js

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

CLI Server - Python

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp-server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remote Server

```
// MCP server using HTTP or SSE - runs on a server
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### [Static OAuth for remote servers](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#static-oauth-for-remote-servers)

For MCP servers that use OAuth, you can provide **static OAuth client credentials** in `mcp.json` instead of dynamic client registration. Use this when:

- The MCP provider gives you a fixed **Client ID** (and optionally **Client Secret**)
- The provider requires **whitelisting a redirect URL** (e.g. Figma, Linear)
- The provider does not support OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration

Add an `auth` object to remote server entries that use `url`:

Remote Server with Static OAuth

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oauth-server": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      "auth": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "your-oauth-client-id",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
        "scopes": ["read", "write"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CLIENT\_ID** | Yes | OAuth 2.0 Client ID from the MCP provider |
| **CLIENT\_SECRET** | No | OAuth 2.0 Client Secret (if the provider uses confidential clients) |
| **scopes** | No | OAuth scopes to request. If omitted, Cursor will use `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` to discover `scopes_supported` |

#### [Static redirect URL](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#static-redirect-url)

Cursor uses a **fixed OAuth redirect URL** for all MCP servers:

```
cursor://anysphere.cursor-mcp/oauth/callback
```

When configuring the MCP provider's OAuth app, register this URL as an allowed redirect URI. The server is identified via the OAuth `state` parameter, so one redirect URL works for all MCP servers.

#### [Combining with config interpolation](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#combining-with-config-interpolation)

`auth` values support the same interpolation as other fields:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oauth-server": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      "auth": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "${env:MCP_CLIENT_ID}",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "${env:MCP_CLIENT_SECRET}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use environment variables for Client ID and Client Secret instead of hardcoding them.

### [STDIO server configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#stdio-server-configuration)

For STDIO servers (local command-line servers), configure these fields in your `mcp.json`:

| Field | Required | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | Yes | Server connection type | `"stdio"` |
| **command** | Yes | Command to start the server executable. Must be available on your system path or contain its full path. | `"npx"`, `"node"`, `"python"`, `"docker"` |
| **args** | No | Array of arguments passed to the command | `["server.py", "--port", "3000"]` |
| **env** | No | Environment variables for the server | `{"API_KEY": "${env:api-key}"}` |
| **envFile** | No | Path to an environment file to load more variables | `".env"`, `"${workspaceFolder}/.env"` |

The `envFile` option is only available for STDIO servers. Remote servers (HTTP/SSE) do not support `envFile`. For remote servers, use [config interpolation](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp#config-interpolation) with environment variables set in your shell profile or system environment instead.

### [Using the Extension API](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#using-the-extension-api)

For programmatic MCP server registration, Cursor provides an extension API that allows dynamic configuration without modifying `mcp.json` files. This is particularly useful for enterprise environments and automated setup workflows.

[MCP Extension API Reference\\
\\
Learn how to register MCP servers programmatically using\\
`vscode.cursor.mcp.registerServer()`](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp-extension-api)

### [Configuration locations](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#configuration-locations)

Project Configuration

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project for project-specific tools.

Global Configuration

Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json` in your home directory for tools available everywhere.

### [Config interpolation](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#config-interpolation)

Use variables in `mcp.json` values. Cursor resolves variables in these fields: `command`, `args`, `env`, `url`, and `headers`.

Supported syntax:

- `${env:NAME}` environment variables
- `${userHome}` path to your home folder
- `${workspaceFolder}` project root (the folder that contains `.cursor/mcp.json`)
- `${workspaceFolderBasename}` name of the project root
- `${pathSeparator}` and `${/}` OS path separator

Examples

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/tools/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "${env:API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-server": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:MY_SERVICE_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#authentication)

MCP servers use environment variables for authentication. Pass API keys and tokens through the config.

Cursor supports OAuth for servers that require it.

## [Using MCP in chat](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#using-mcp-in-chat)

Agent automatically uses MCP tools listed under `Available Tools` when relevant. This includes [Plan Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/plan-mode#plan). Ask for a specific tool by name or describe what you need. Enable or disable tools from settings.

### [Tool approval](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#tool-approval)

Agent asks for approval before using MCP tools by default. Click the arrow next to the tool name to see arguments.

![Tool confirmation prompt](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fmcp%2Ftool-confirm.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_7zPiZUsTD7ownHrxp4Gk37N86tFn)

#### [Auto-run](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#auto-run)

Enable auto-run for Agent to use MCP tools without asking. Works like terminal commands. Read more about Auto-run settings [here](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview#auto-run).

### [Tool response](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#tool-response)

Cursor shows the response in chat with expandable views of arguments and responses:

![MCP tool call result](https://cursor.com/docs-static/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs-static%2Fimages%2Fcontext%2Fmcp%2Ftool-call.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_7zPiZUsTD7ownHrxp4Gk37N86tFn)

### [Images as context](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#images-as-context)

MCP servers can return images - screenshots, diagrams, etc. Return them as base64 encoded strings:

```
const RED_CIRCLE_BASE64 = "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgEASABIAAD/2w...";
// ^ full base64 clipped for readability

server.tool("generate_image", async (params) => {
  return {
    content: [\
      {\
        type: "image",\
        data: RED_CIRCLE_BASE64,\
        mimeType: "image/jpeg",\
      },\
    ],
  };
});
```

See this [example server](https://github.com/msfeldstein/mcp-test-servers/blob/main/src/image-server.js) for implementation details. Cursor attaches returned images to the chat. If the model supports images, it analyzes them.

## [Security considerations](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#security-considerations)

When installing MCP servers, consider these security practices:

- **Verify the source**: Only install MCP servers from trusted developers and repositories
- **Review permissions**: Check what data and APIs the server will access
- **Limit API keys**: Use restricted API keys with minimal required permissions
- **Audit code**: For critical integrations, review the server's source code

Remember that MCP servers can access external services and execute code on your behalf. Always understand what a server does before installation.

## [Real-world examples](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#real-world-examples)

For practical examples of MCP in action, see our [Web Development guide](https://cursor.com/for/web-development) which demonstrates integrating Linear, Figma, and browser tools into your development workflow.

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp\#faq)

### What's the point of MCP servers?

MCP servers connect Cursor to external tools like Google Drive, Notion, and
other services to bring docs and requirements into your coding workflow.

### How do I debug MCP server issues?

View MCP logs by:

1. Open the Output panel in Cursor ( `Cmd+Shift+UCtrl+Shift+U`)
2. Select "MCP Logs" from the dropdown
3. Check for connection errors, authentication issues, or server crashes

The logs show server initialization, tool calls, and error messages.

### Can I temporarily disable an MCP server?

Yes! Toggle servers on/off without removing them:

1. Open Settings ( `Cmd+Shift+JCtrl+Shift+J`)
2. Go to Features → Model Context Protocol
3. Click the toggle next to any server to enable/disable

Disabled servers won't load or appear in chat. This is useful for troubleshooting or reducing tool clutter.

### What happens if an MCP server crashes or times out?

If an MCP server fails:

- Cursor shows an error message in chat
- The tool call is marked as failed
- You can retry the operation or check logs for details
- Other MCP servers continue working normally

Cursor isolates server failures to prevent one server from affecting others.

### How do I update an MCP server?

For npm-based servers:

1. Remove the server from settings
2. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Re-add the server to get the latest version

For custom servers, update your local files and restart Cursor.

### Can I use MCP servers with sensitive data?

Yes, but follow security best practices:

- Use environment variables for secrets, never hardcode them
- Run sensitive servers locally with `stdio` transport
- Limit API key permissions to minimum required
- Review server code before connecting to sensitive systems
- Consider running servers in isolated environments
