# Admin API

The Admin API lets you programmatically access your team's data, including member information, usage metrics, and spending details.

- The Admin API uses [Basic Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/api#basic-authentication) with your API key as the username.

### [Get Daily Usage Data](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#get-daily-usage-data)

POST`/teams/daily-usage-data`

Retrieve daily usage metrics for your team. Data is aggregated at the hourly level - we recommend polling this endpoint at most once per hour. Rate limited to 20 requests per minute per team. See [best practices](https://cursor.com/docs/api#best-practices).

#### [Parameters](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#parameters-1)

`startDate`numberRequired

Start date in epoch milliseconds

`endDate`numberRequired

End date in epoch milliseconds

`page`number

Page number (1-indexed). When provided along with `pageSize`, enables pagination and returns data for **all team members with a membership during the requested date range**.

`pageSize`number

Number of users per page. When provided along with `page`, enables pagination and returns data for **all team members with a membership during the requested date range**.

Without pagination parameters, this endpoint only returns **active users** (those with activity during the date range). To get **all team members**, include both `page` and `pageSize` parameters.

When using pagination, the response includes an `isActive` field for each user indicating whether they had activity on that day. Members who joined after the requested period are excluded.

Date range cannot exceed 30 days. Make multiple requests for longer periods.

The fields `subscriptionIncludedReqs`, `usageBasedReqs`, and `apiKeyReqs` count raw usage events, not billable request units in older request-based pricing. To get accurate billable request counts, use the [`/teams/filtered-usage-events`](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api#get-usage-events-data) endpoint and sum the `requestsCosts` field.

#### [Response Fields](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api\#response-fields-2)

Each object in the `data` array contains:

- `userId`number \- Unique identifier for the user
