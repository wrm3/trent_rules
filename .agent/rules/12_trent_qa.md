# Quality Assurance System

This rule provides comprehensive quality assurance functionality including bug tracking, design fix documentation, and quality management.

## Bug Tracking System

### Bug Classification
- **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- **High**: Major feature failures, performance degradation >50%
- **Medium**: Minor feature issues, usability problems
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests

### Bug Source Attribution
- **User Reported**: Issues reported by end users or stakeholders
- **Development**: Bugs discovered during feature development
- **Testing**: Issues found during QA or automated testing
- **Production**: Live environment issues requiring immediate attention

### BUGS.md Integration
**Location**: `.trent/BUGS.md`

**Purpose**: Centralized bug tracking that integrates with TASKS.md system

**Format**:
```markdown
# Bug Tracking

## Active Bugs

### Bug ID: BUG-001
- **Title**: [Brief description of the issue]
- **Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Source**: [User Reported/Development/Testing/Production]
- **Phase Impact**: [List affected phases]
- **Status**: [Open/Investigating/Fixing/Testing/Closed]
- **Task Reference**: [Link to task in TASKS.md]
- **Created**: [Date]
- **Assigned**: [Developer/Team]

## Bug Template
```yaml
---
id: BUG-{number}
title: '[BUG] {Brief description of the issue}'
severity: {critical|high|medium|low}
source: {user_reported|development|testing|production}
phase_impact: [affected_phases]
status: {open|investigating|fixing|testing|closed}
task_reference: {task_id}
created_date: '{discovery_date}'
assigned_to: {developer}
---
```

### Bug Task Integration
When a bug is identified:
1. **Create BUGS.md entry** with bug details
2. **Create corresponding task** in TASKS.md with `[BUG]` prefix
3. **Create task file** in tasks/ folder with bug type
4. **Link bug to affected phases** in phase documents
5. **Track resolution** through task completion

### Bug Task Template
```yaml
---
id: {next_available_id}
title: '[BUG] {Brief description of the issue}'
type: bug_fix
status: pending
priority: {severity_level}
phase: {affected_phase_number}
subsystems: {affected_subsystems}
project_context: 'Resolves {bug_type} affecting {system_component}, maintaining {expected_behavior}'
bug_reference: BUG-{number}
severity: {critical|high|medium|low}
source: {user_reported|development|testing|production}
reproduction_steps: {step_by_step_instructions}
expected_behavior: {what_should_happen}
actual_behavior: {what_actually_happens}
---
```

## Design Fix Documentation

### Retroactive Fix Documentation
**Purpose**: Capture and document design fixes, bug resolutions, and improvements completed in chat for historical context and memory preservation.

### Activation Points
**When**: After completing any unplanned fix, improvement, or solution in chat
**Actions**:
1. Assess if the work merits task documentation
2. Generate retroactive task entry
3. Update TASKS.md with completed status
4. Archive to memory if appropriate

### Scope Assessment Criteria
**Document as retroactive task if**:
- ✅ Fix required >15 minutes of work
- ✅ Solution affects multiple files or subsystems  
- ✅ Fix provides value for future reference
- ✅ Resolution required technical analysis or debugging

**Skip documentation if**:
- ❌ Simple typo corrections
- ❌ Minor formatting adjustments
- ❌ Clarification-only conversations

### Retroactive Task Template
```yaml
---
id: {next_available_id}
title: '[RETROACTIVE] {Description of fix/improvement}'
type: retroactive_fix
status: completed
priority: {original_urgency_level}
created_date: '{fix_completion_date}'
completed_date: '{fix_completion_date}'
project_context: 'Documents previously completed {solution_type} that addressed {project_need}, maintaining {system_capability}'
subsystems: {affected_subsystems}
estimated_effort: '{actual_time_spent}'
actual_effort: '{actual_time_spent}'
---
```

### Implementation Workflow
1. **Fix Assessment**: Review completed chat work against scope criteria
2. **Task Creation**: Generate task file using retroactive template
3. **System Integration**: Add entry to TASKS.md with completed status
4. **Archive**: Archive to memory if task meets archival criteria

## Documentation Templates

### Standardized Templates
**Purpose**: Ensure consistent documentation quality and reduce creation overhead.

### Task Template
```markdown
# Task: {title}
**ID:** {task_id}
**Priority:** {critical|high|medium|low}
**Status:** {pending|in-progress|review|completed}
**Estimated Effort:** {story_points}

## Objective
{Clear, actionable goal description}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {Specific, measurable outcome}
- [ ] {Verification requirement}
- [ ] {Quality standard}

## Implementation Notes
{Technical details, dependencies, constraints}

## Verification
- [ ] Functionality tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Integration verified
```

### Bug Template
```markdown
# Bug: {title}
**ID:** {bug_id}
**Severity:** {critical|high|medium|low}
**Source:** {user_report|testing|production|code_review}
**Status:** {open|investigating|fixing|testing|closed}

## Problem Description
{What is broken or not working as expected}

## Reproduction Steps
1. {Step-by-step instructions}
2. {Expected vs actual behavior}

## Environment
- System: {operating_system}
- Version: {software_version}
- Configuration: {relevant_settings}

## Fix Implementation
{Solution approach and technical details}

## Verification
- [ ] Bug reproduced
- [ ] Fix implemented
- [ ] Regression testing completed
```

### Design Fix Template
```markdown
# Design Fix: {title}
**Context:** {Original issue or improvement need}
**Impact:** {Affected systems or workflows}
**Date:** {implementation_date}

## Problem Analysis
{Root cause and contributing factors}

## Solution Implementation
{What was changed and why}

## Validation Results
{Evidence that fix addresses the problem}

## Lessons Learned
{Insights for preventing similar issues}
```

## Quality Management Workflow

### Bug Lifecycle
1. **Bug Discovery**: Bug identified and reported
2. **Bug Documentation**: Entry created in BUGS.md
3. **Task Creation**: Corresponding task created in TASKS.md
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and impact assessment
5. **Fix Implementation**: Solution developed and tested
6. **Verification**: Fix validated and regression tested
7. **Documentation**: Fix documented and lessons learned captured
8. **Closure**: Bug marked as resolved, task completed

### Quality Metrics
- **Bug Discovery Rate**: Bugs found per development cycle
- **Bug Resolution Time**: Average time from discovery to resolution
- **Bug Severity Distribution**: Breakdown of bugs by severity level
- **Phase Impact Analysis**: Which phases are most affected by bugs
- **Regression Rate**: Percentage of fixes that introduce new bugs
- **Code Reuse Rate**: Ratio of shared module imports to total imports across the codebase
- **Duplication Score**: Number of duplicated code patterns detected (target: 0 violations of 3-strike rule)

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing
- **Documentation Standards**: Code comments, API documentation, user guides
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Performance regression testing
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability scanning
- **Reusability Standards**: No 3-strike rule violations, shared modules used where available, no inline utilities that belong in lib/utils/ (see 04_code_reusability.md)

## Integration Points

### Task System Integration
- Bugs automatically create corresponding tasks
- Task completion updates bug status
- Bug metrics integrated with task performance metrics
- Phase impact tracking through task-phase relationships

### Planning System Integration
