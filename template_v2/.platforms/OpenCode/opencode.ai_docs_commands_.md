# Commands

Create custom commands for repetitive tasks.

Custom commands let you specify a prompt you want to run when that command is executed in the TUI.

```
/my-command
```

Custom commands are in addition to the built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`. [Learn more](https://opencode.ai/docs/tui#commands).

* * *

## [Create command files](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#create-command-files)

Create markdown files in the `commands/` directory to define custom commands.

Create `.opencode/commands/test.md`:

```
---

description: Run tests with coverage

agent: build

model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

---

Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.

Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The frontmatter defines command properties. The content becomes the template.

Use the command by typing `/` followed by the command name.

```
"/test"
```

* * *

## [Configure](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#configure)

You can add custom commands through the OpenCode config or by creating markdown files in the `commands/` directory.

* * *

### [JSON](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#json)

Use the `command` option in your OpenCode [config](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

```
{

  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",

  "command": {

    // This becomes the name of the command

    "test": {

      // This is the prompt that will be sent to the LLM

      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.",

      // This is shown as the description in the TUI

      "description": "Run tests with coverage",

      "agent": "build",

      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

    }

  }

}
```

Now you can run this command in the TUI:

```
/test
```

* * *

### [Markdown](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#markdown)

You can also define commands using markdown files. Place them in:

- Global: `~/.config/opencode/commands/`
- Per-project: `.opencode/commands/`

```
---

description: Run tests with coverage

agent: build

model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

---

Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.

Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The markdown file name becomes the command name. For example, `test.md` lets
you run:

```
/test
```

* * *

## [Prompt config](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#prompt-config)

The prompts for the custom commands support several special placeholders and syntax.

* * *

### [Arguments](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#arguments)

Pass arguments to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

```
---

description: Create a new component

---

Create a new React component named $ARGUMENTS with TypeScript support.

Include proper typing and basic structure.
```

Run the command with arguments:

```
/component Button
```

And `$ARGUMENTS` will be replaced with `Button`.

You can also access individual arguments using positional parameters:

- `$1` \- First argument
- `$2` \- Second argument
- `$3` \- Third argument
- And so on…

For example:

```
---

description: Create a new file with content

---

Create a file named $1 in the directory $2

with the following content: $3
```

Run the command:

```
/create-file config.json src "{ \"key\": \"value\" }"
```

This replaces:

- `$1` with `config.json`
- `$2` with `src`
- `$3` with `{ "key": "value" }`

* * *

### [Shell output](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#shell-output)

Use _!`command`_ to inject [bash command](https://opencode.ai/docs/tui#bash-commands) output into your prompt.

For example, to create a custom command that analyzes test coverage:

```
---

description: Analyze test coverage

---

Here are the current test results:

!`npm test`

Based on these results, suggest improvements to increase coverage.
```

Or to review recent changes:

```
---

description: Review recent changes

---

Recent git commits:

!`git log --oneline -10`

Review these changes and suggest any improvements.
```

Commands run in your project’s root directory and their output becomes part of the prompt.

* * *

### [File references](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#file-references)

Include files in your command using `@` followed by the filename.

```
---

description: Review component

---

Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx.

Check for performance issues and suggest improvements.
```

The file content gets included in the prompt automatically.

* * *

## [Options](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#options)

Let’s look at the configuration options in detail.

* * *

### [Template](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#template)

The `template` option defines the prompt that will be sent to the LLM when the command is executed.

```
{

  "command": {

    "test": {

      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes."

    }

  }

}
```

This is a **required** config option.

* * *

### [Description](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#description)

Use the `description` option to provide a brief description of what the command does.

```
{

  "command": {

    "test": {

      "description": "Run tests with coverage"

    }

  }

}
```

This is shown as the description in the TUI when you type in the command.

* * *

### [Agent](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#agent)

Use the `agent` config to optionally specify which [agent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents) should execute this command.
If this is a [subagent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/#subagents) the command will trigger a subagent invocation by default.
To disable this behavior, set `subtask` to `false`.

```
{

  "command": {

    "review": {

      "agent": "plan"

    }

  }

}
```

This is an **optional** config option. If not specified, defaults to your current agent.

* * *

### [Subtask](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#subtask)

Use the `subtask` boolean to force the command to trigger a [subagent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/#subagents) invocation.
This is useful if you want the command to not pollute your primary context and will **force** the agent to act as a subagent,
even if `mode` is set to `primary` on the [agent](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents) configuration.

```
{

  "command": {

    "analyze": {

      "subtask": true

    }

  }

}
```

This is an **optional** config option.

* * *

### [Model](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#model)

Use the `model` config to override the default model for this command.

```
{

  "command": {

    "analyze": {

      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

    }

  }

}
```

This is an **optional** config option.

* * *

## [Built-in](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/\#built-in)

opencode includes several built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`; [learn more](https://opencode.ai/docs/tui#commands).

If you define a custom command with the same name, it will override the built-in command.
