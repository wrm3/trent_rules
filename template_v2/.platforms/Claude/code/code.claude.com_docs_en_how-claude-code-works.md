Claude Code is an agentic assistant that runs in your terminal. While it excels at coding, it can help with anything you can do from the command line: writing docs, running builds, searching files, researching topics, and more.This guide covers the core architecture, built-in capabilities, and [tips for working effectively](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#work-effectively-with-claude-code). For step-by-step walkthroughs, see [Common workflows](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows). For extensibility features like skills, MCP, and hooks, see [Extend Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/features-overview).

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#the-agentic-loop)  The agentic loop

When you give Claude a task, it works through three phases: **gather context**, **take action**, and **verify results**. These phases blend together. Claude uses tools throughout, whether searching files to understand your code, editing to make changes, or running tests to check its work.![The agentic loop: Your prompt leads to Claude gathering context, taking action, verifying results, and repeating until task complete. You can interrupt at any point.](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/TBPmHzr19mDCuhZi/images/agentic-loop.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=TBPmHzr19mDCuhZi&q=85&s=9d9cdb2102f397a0f57450ca5ca2a969)The loop adapts to what you ask. A question about your codebase might only need context gathering. A bug fix cycles through all three phases repeatedly. A refactor might involve extensive verification. Claude decides what each step requires based on what it learned from the previous step, chaining dozens of actions together and course-correcting along the way.You’re part of this loop too. You can interrupt at any point to steer Claude in a different direction, provide additional context, or ask it to try a different approach. Claude works autonomously but stays responsive to your input.The agentic loop is powered by two components: [models](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#models) that reason and [tools](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#tools) that act. Claude Code serves as the **agentic harness** around Claude: it provides the tools, context management, and execution environment that turn a language model into a capable coding agent.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#models)  Models

Claude Code uses Claude models to understand your code and reason about tasks. Claude can read code in any language, understand how components connect, and figure out what needs to change to accomplish your goal. For complex tasks, it breaks work into steps, executes them, and adjusts based on what it learns.[Multiple models](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config) are available with different tradeoffs. Sonnet handles most coding tasks well. Opus provides stronger reasoning for complex architectural decisions. Switch with `/model` during a session or start with `claude --model <name>`.When this guide says “Claude chooses” or “Claude decides,” it’s the model doing the reasoning.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#tools)  Tools

Tools are what make Claude Code agentic. Without tools, Claude can only respond with text. With tools, Claude can act: read your code, edit files, run commands, search the web, and interact with external services. Each tool use returns information that feeds back into the loop, informing Claude’s next decision.The built-in tools generally fall into five categories, each representing a different kind of agency.

| Category | What Claude can do |
| --- | --- |
| **File operations** | Read files, edit code, create new files, rename and reorganize |
| **Search** | Find files by pattern, search content with regex, explore codebases |
| **Execution** | Run shell commands, start servers, run tests, use git |
| **Web** | Search the web, fetch documentation, look up error messages |
| **Code intelligence** | See type errors and warnings after edits, jump to definitions, find references (requires [code intelligence plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence)) |

These are the primary capabilities. Claude also has tools for spawning subagents, asking you questions, and other orchestration tasks. See [Tools available to Claude](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) for the complete list.Claude chooses which tools to use based on your prompt and what it learns along the way. When you say “fix the failing tests,” Claude might:

1. Run the test suite to see what’s failing
2. Read the error output
3. Search for the relevant source files
4. Read those files to understand the code
5. Edit the files to fix the issue
6. Run the tests again to verify

Each tool use gives Claude new information that informs the next step. This is the agentic loop in action.**Extending the base capabilities:** The built-in tools are the foundation. You can extend what Claude knows with [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), connect to external services with [MCP](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp), automate workflows with [hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks), and offload tasks to [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents). These extensions form a layer on top of the core agentic loop. See [Extend Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/features-overview) for guidance on choosing the right extension for your needs.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#what-claude-can-access)  What Claude can access

This guide focuses on the terminal. Claude Code also runs in [VS Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code), [JetBrains IDEs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/jetbrains), and other environments.When you run `claude` in a directory, Claude Code gains access to:

- **Your project.** Files in your directory and subdirectories, plus files elsewhere with your permission.
- **Your terminal.** Any command you could run: build tools, git, package managers, system utilities, scripts. If you can do it from the command line, Claude can too.
- **Your git state.** Current branch, uncommitted changes, and recent commit history.
- **Your [CLAUDE.md](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory).** A markdown file where you store project-specific instructions, conventions, and context that Claude should know every session.
- **[Auto memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#auto-memory).** Learnings Claude saves automatically as you work, like project patterns and your preferences. The first 200 lines of MEMORY.md are loaded at the start of each session.
- **Extensions you configure.** [MCP servers](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) for external services, [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) for workflows, [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for delegated work, and [Claude in Chrome](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome) for browser interaction.

Because Claude sees your whole project, it can work across it. When you ask Claude to “fix the authentication bug,” it searches for relevant files, reads multiple files to understand context, makes coordinated edits across them, runs tests to verify the fix, and commits the changes if you ask. This is different from inline code assistants that only see the current file.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#environments-and-interfaces)  Environments and interfaces

The agentic loop, tools, and capabilities described above are the same everywhere you use Claude Code. What changes is where the code executes and how you interact with it.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#execution-environments)  Execution environments

Claude Code runs in three environments, each with different tradeoffs for where your code executes.

| Environment | Where code runs | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Local** | Your machine | Default. Full access to your files, tools, and environment |
| **Cloud** | Anthropic-managed VMs | Offload tasks, work on repos you don’t have locally |
| **Remote Control** | Your machine, controlled from a browser | Use the web UI while keeping everything local |

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#interfaces)  Interfaces

You can access Claude Code through the terminal, the [desktop app](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop), [IDE extensions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/ide-integrations), [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code), [Remote Control](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/remote-control), [Slack](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slack), and [CI/CD pipelines](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/github-actions). The interface determines how you see and interact with Claude, but the underlying agentic loop is identical. See [Use Claude Code everywhere](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview#use-claude-code-everywhere) for the full list.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#work-with-sessions)  Work with sessions

Claude Code saves your conversation locally as you work. Each message, tool use, and result is stored, which enables [rewinding](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#undo-changes-with-checkpoints), [resuming, and forking](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#resume-or-fork-sessions) sessions. Before Claude makes code changes, it also snapshots the affected files so you can revert if needed.**Sessions are independent.** Each new session starts with a fresh context window, without the conversation history from previous sessions. Claude can persist learnings across sessions using [auto memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#auto-memory), and you can add your own persistent instructions in [CLAUDE.md](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory).

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#work-across-branches)  Work across branches

Each Claude Code conversation is a session tied to your current directory. When you resume, you only see sessions from that directory.Claude sees your current branch’s files. When you switch branches, Claude sees the new branch’s files, but your conversation history stays the same. Claude remembers what you discussed even after switching.Since sessions are tied to directories, you can run parallel Claude sessions by using [git worktrees](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees), which create separate directories for individual branches.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#resume-or-fork-sessions)  Resume or fork sessions

When you resume a session with `claude --continue` or `claude --resume`, you pick up where you left off using the same session ID. New messages append to the existing conversation. Your full conversation history is restored, but session-scoped permissions are not. You’ll need to re-approve those.![Session continuity: resume continues the same session, fork creates a new branch with a new ID.](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/TBPmHzr19mDCuhZi/images/session-continuity.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=TBPmHzr19mDCuhZi&q=85&s=808da1b213c731bf98874c75981d688b)To branch off and try a different approach without affecting the original session, use the `--fork-session` flag:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
claude --continue --fork-session
```

This creates a new session ID while preserving the conversation history up to that point. The original session remains unchanged. Like resume, forked sessions don’t inherit session-scoped permissions.**Same session in multiple terminals**: If you resume the same session in multiple terminals, both terminals write to the same session file. Messages from both get interleaved, like two people writing in the same notebook. Nothing corrupts, but the conversation becomes jumbled. Each terminal only sees its own messages during the session, but if you resume that session later, you’ll see everything interleaved. For parallel work from the same starting point, use `--fork-session` to give each terminal its own clean session.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#the-context-window)  The context window

Claude’s context window holds your conversation history, file contents, command outputs, [CLAUDE.md](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory), loaded skills, and system instructions. As you work, context fills up. Claude compacts automatically, but instructions from early in the conversation can get lost. Put persistent rules in CLAUDE.md, and run `/context` to see what’s using space.

#### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#when-context-fills-up)  When context fills up

Claude Code manages context automatically as you approach the limit. It clears older tool outputs first, then summarizes the conversation if needed. Your requests and key code snippets are preserved; detailed instructions from early in the conversation may be lost. Put persistent rules in CLAUDE.md rather than relying on conversation history.To control what’s preserved during compaction, add a “Compact Instructions” section to CLAUDE.md or run `/compact` with a focus (like `/compact focus on the API changes`).Run `/context` to see what’s using space. MCP servers add tool definitions to every request, so a few servers can consume significant context before you start working. Run `/mcp` to check per-server costs.

#### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#manage-context-with-skills-and-subagents)  Manage context with skills and subagents

Beyond compaction, you can use other features to control what loads into context.[Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) load on demand. Claude sees skill descriptions at session start, but the full content only loads when a skill is used. For skills you invoke manually, set `disable-model-invocation: true` to keep descriptions out of context until you need them.[Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) get their own fresh context, completely separate from your main conversation. Their work doesn’t bloat your context. When done, they return a summary. This isolation is why subagents help with long sessions.See [context costs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/features-overview#understand-context-costs) for what each feature costs, and [reduce token usage](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs#reduce-token-usage) for tips on managing context.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#stay-safe-with-checkpoints-and-permissions)  Stay safe with checkpoints and permissions

Claude has two safety mechanisms: checkpoints let you undo file changes, and permissions control what Claude can do without asking.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#undo-changes-with-checkpoints)  Undo changes with checkpoints

**Every file edit is reversible.** Before Claude edits any file, it snapshots the current contents. If something goes wrong, press `Esc` twice to rewind to a previous state, or ask Claude to undo.Checkpoints are local to your session, separate from git. They only cover file changes. Actions that affect remote systems (databases, APIs, deployments) can’t be checkpointed, which is why Claude asks before running commands with external side effects.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#control-what-claude-can-do)  Control what Claude can do

Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through permission modes:

- **Default**: Claude asks before file edits and shell commands
- **Auto-accept edits**: Claude edits files without asking, still asks for commands
- **Plan mode**: Claude uses read-only tools only, creating a plan you can approve before execution

You can also allow specific commands in `.claude/settings.json` so Claude doesn’t ask each time. This is useful for trusted commands like `npm test` or `git status`. Settings can be scoped from organization-wide policies down to personal preferences. See [Permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions) for details.

## [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#work-effectively-with-claude-code)  Work effectively with Claude Code

These tips help you get better results from Claude Code.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#ask-claude-code-for-help)  Ask Claude Code for help

Claude Code can teach you how to use it. Ask questions like “how do I set up hooks?” or “what’s the best way to structure my CLAUDE.md?” and Claude will explain.Built-in commands also guide you through setup:

- `/init` walks you through creating a CLAUDE.md for your project
- `/agents` helps you configure custom subagents
- `/doctor` diagnoses common issues with your installation

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#it%E2%80%99s-a-conversation)  It’s a conversation

Claude Code is conversational. You don’t need perfect prompts. Start with what you want, then refine:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
Fix the login bug
```

\[Claude investigates, tries something\]

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
That's not quite right. The issue is in the session handling.
```

\[Claude adjusts approach\]When the first attempt isn’t right, you don’t start over. You iterate.

#### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#interrupt-and-steer)  Interrupt and steer

You can interrupt Claude at any point. If it’s going down the wrong path, just type your correction and press Enter. Claude will stop what it’s doing and adjust its approach based on your input. You don’t have to wait for it to finish or start over.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#be-specific-upfront)  Be specific upfront

The more precise your initial prompt, the fewer corrections you’ll need. Reference specific files, mention constraints, and point to example patterns.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
The checkout flow is broken for users with expired cards.
Check src/payments/ for the issue, especially token refresh.
Write a failing test first, then fix it.
```

Vague prompts work, but you’ll spend more time steering. Specific prompts like the one above often succeed on the first attempt.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#give-claude-something-to-verify-against)  Give Claude something to verify against

Claude performs better when it can check its own work. Include test cases, paste screenshots of expected UI, or define the output you want.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
Implement validateEmail. Test cases: 'user@example.com' → true,
'invalid' → false, 'user@.com' → false. Run the tests after.
```

For visual work, paste a screenshot of the design and ask Claude to compare its implementation against it.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#explore-before-implementing)  Explore before implementing

For complex problems, separate research from coding. Use plan mode (`Shift+Tab` twice) to analyze the codebase first:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
Read src/auth/ and understand how we handle sessions.
Then create a plan for adding OAuth support.
```

Review the plan, refine it through conversation, then let Claude implement. This two-phase approach produces better results than jumping straight to code.

### [​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works\#delegate-don%E2%80%99t-dictate)  Delegate, don’t dictate

Think of delegating to a capable colleague. Give context and direction, then trust Claude to figure out the details:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

```
The checkout flow is broken for users with expired cards.
The relevant code is in src/payments/. Can you investigate and fix it?
```

You don’t need to specify which files to read or what commands to run. Claude figures that out.
