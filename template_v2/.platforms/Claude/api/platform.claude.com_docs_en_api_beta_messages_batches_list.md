created\_at: string

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

formatdate-time

expires\_at: string

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch will expire and end processing, which is 24 hours after creation.

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

canceled: number

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have been canceled.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

errored: number

Number of requests in the Message Batch that encountered an error.

succeeded: number

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

results\_url: string

URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

type: "message\_batch"

Object type.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.

first\_id: string

First ID in the `data` list. Can be used as the `before_id` for the previous page.
