# Create a Text Completion

POST/v1/complete

\[Legacy\] Create a Text Completion.

The Text Completions API is a legacy API. We recommend using the [Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages) going forward.

Future models and features will not be compatible with Text Completions. See our [migration guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/migrating-from-text-completions-to-messages) for guidance in migrating from Text Completions to Messages.

##### Body ParametersJSONExpand Collapse

max\_tokens\_to\_sample: number

The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

minimum1

UnionMember1 = string

prompt: string

The prompt that you want Claude to complete.

For proper response generation you will need to format your prompt using alternating \`

Human:`and`

Assistant:\` conversational turns. For example:

```
"

Human: {userQuestion}

Assistant:"
```

See [prompt validation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/prompt-validation) and our guide to [prompt design](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/intro-to-prompting) for more details.

minLength1

metadata: optional [Metadata](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages#metadata) { user\_id }

An object describing metadata about the request.

user\_id: optional string

An external identifier for the user who is associated with the request.

This should be a uuid, hash value, or other opaque identifier. Anthropic may use this id to help detect abuse. Do not include any identifying information such as name, email address, or phone number.

maxLength256

stop\_sequences: optional array of string

Sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

Our models stop on \`"

Human:"\`, and may include additional built-in stop sequences in the future. By providing the stop\_sequences parameter, you may include additional strings that will cause the model to stop generating.

stream: optional boolean

Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

See [streaming](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/streaming) for details.

temperature: optional number

Amount of randomness injected into the response.

Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

maximum1

minimum0

top\_k: optional number

Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.

minimum0

top\_p: optional number

Use nucleus sampling.

In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.
