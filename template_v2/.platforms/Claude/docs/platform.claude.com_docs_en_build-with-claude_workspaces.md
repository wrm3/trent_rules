Workspaces

Copy page

Workspaces provide a way to organize your API usage within an organization. Use workspaces to separate different projects, environments, or teams while maintaining centralized billing and administration.

## How workspaces work

Every organization has a **Default Workspace** that cannot be renamed, archived, or deleted. When you create additional workspaces, you can assign API keys, members, and resource limits to each one.

Key characteristics:

- **Workspace identifiers** use the `wrkspc_` prefix (e.g., `wrkspc_01JwQvzr7rXLA5AGx3HKfFUJ`)
- **Maximum 100 workspaces** per organization (archived workspaces don't count)
- **Default Workspace** has no ID and doesn't appear in list endpoints
- **API keys** are scoped to a single workspace and can only access resources within that workspace

## Workspace roles and permissions

Members can have different roles in each workspace, allowing fine-grained access control.

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace User | Use the Workbench only |
| Workspace Developer | Create and manage API keys, use the API |
| Workspace Admin | Full control over workspace settings and members |
| Workspace Billing | View workspace billing information (inherited from organization billing role) |

### Role inheritance

- **Organization admins** automatically receive Workspace Admin access to all workspaces
- **Organization billing members** automatically receive Workspace Billing access to all workspaces
- **Organization users and developers** must be explicitly added to each workspace

The Workspace Billing role cannot be manually assigned. It's inherited from having the organization billing role.

## Managing workspaces

Only organization admins can create workspaces. Organization users and developers must be added to workspaces by an admin.

### Via the Console

Create and manage workspaces in the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/workspaces).

#### Create a workspace

1. 1



Open workspace settings







In the Claude Console, go to **Settings > Workspaces**.

2. 2



Add a new workspace







Click **Add Workspace**.

3. 3



Configure the workspace







Enter a workspace name and select a color for visual identification.

4. 4



Create the workspace







Click **Create** to finalize.


To switch between workspaces in the Console, use the **Workspaces** selector in the top-left corner.

#### Edit workspace details

To modify a workspace's name or color:

1. Select the workspace from the list
2. Click the ellipsis menu ( **...**) and choose **Edit details**
3. Update the name or color and save your changes

The Default Workspace cannot be renamed or deleted.

#### Add members to a workspace

1. Navigate to the workspace's **Members** tab
2. Click **Add to Workspace**
3. Select an organization member and assign them a [workspace role](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/workspaces#workspace-roles-and-permissions)
4. Confirm the addition

To remove a member, click the trash icon next to their name.

Organization admins and billing members cannot be removed from workspaces while they hold those organization roles.

#### Set workspace limits

In the **Limits** tab, you can configure:

- **Rate limits**: Set limits per model tier for requests per minute, input tokens, or output tokens
- **Spend notifications**: Configure alerts when spending reaches certain thresholds

#### Archive a workspace

To archive a workspace, click the ellipsis menu ( **...**) and select **Archive**. Archiving:

- Preserves historical data for reporting
- Deactivates the workspace and all associated API keys
- Cannot be undone

Archiving a workspace immediately revokes all API keys in that workspace. This action cannot be undone.

### Via the Admin API

Programmatically manage workspaces using the [Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/administration-api).

Admin API endpoints require an Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin...`) that differs from standard API keys. Only organization members with the admin role can provision Admin API keys through the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/admin-keys).

```
# Create a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"name": "Production"}'

# List workspaces
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces?limit=10&include_archived=false" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Archive a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/archive" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see the [Workspaces API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspaces/get-workspace).

### Managing workspace members

Add, update, or remove members from a workspace:

```
# Add a member to a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "user_xxx",
    "workspace_role": "workspace_developer"
  }'

# Update a member's role
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"workspace_role": "workspace_admin"}'

# Remove a member from a workspace
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

For complete parameter details, see the [Workspace Members API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspace_members/get-workspace-member).

## API keys and resource scoping

API keys are scoped to a specific workspace. When you create an API key in a workspace, it can only access resources within that workspace.

Resources scoped to workspaces include:

- **Files** created via the [Files API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/files)
- **Message Batches** created via the [Batch API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)
- **Skills** created via the [Skills API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide)

Starting February 5, 2026, [prompt caches](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) will also be isolated per workspace (applies to the Claude API and Azure only).

To retrieve your organization's workspace IDs, use the [List Workspaces](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspaces/list-workspaces) endpoint, or find them in the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/workspaces).

## Workspace limits

You can set custom spend and rate limits for each workspace to protect against overuse and ensure fair resource distribution.

### Setting workspace limits

Workspace limits can be set lower than (but not higher than) your organization's limits:

- **Spend limits**: Cap monthly spending for a workspace
- **Rate limits**: Limit requests per minute, input tokens per minute, or output tokens per minute

- You cannot set limits on the Default Workspace
- If not set, workspace limits match the organization's limits
- Organization-wide limits always apply, even if workspace limits add up to more

For detailed information on rate limits and how they work, see [Rate limits](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/rate-limits).

## Usage and cost tracking

Track usage and costs by workspace using the [Usage and Cost API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api):

```
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages?\
starting_at=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&\
ending_at=2025-01-08T00:00:00Z&\
workspace_ids[]=wrkspc_01JwQvzr7rXLA5AGx3HKfFUJ&\
group_by[]=workspace_id&\
bucket_width=1d" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Usage and costs attributed to the Default Workspace have a `null` value for `workspace_id`.

## Common use cases

### Environment separation

Create separate workspaces for development, staging, and production:

| Workspace | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Development | Testing and experimentation with lower rate limits |
| Staging | Pre-production testing with production-like limits |
| Production | Live traffic with full rate limits and monitoring |

### Team or department isolation

Assign workspaces to different teams for cost allocation and access control:

- **Engineering team** with developer access
- **Data science team** with their own API keys
- **Support team** with limited access for customer tools

### Project-based organization

Create workspaces for specific projects or products to track usage and costs separately.

## Best practices

1. 1



Plan your workspace structure







Consider how you'll organize workspaces before creating them. Think about billing, access control, and usage tracking needs.

2. 2



Use meaningful names







Name workspaces clearly to indicate their purpose (e.g., "Production - Customer Chatbot", "Dev - Internal Tools").

3. 3



Set appropriate limits







Configure spend and rate limits to prevent unexpected costs and ensure fair resource distribution.

4. 4



Audit access regularly







Review workspace membership periodically to ensure only appropriate users have access.

5. 5



Monitor usage







Use the [Usage and Cost API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api) to track workspace-level consumption.
