Sonnet 4.6 is Anthropic's medium-tier intelligence model. It costs the same as Sonnet 4.5 and supports thinking mode with a 200k default context window expandable to 1M in Max Mode. It's a solid pick for teams standardized on Claude who want reasoning without Opus pricing.

## [Strengths](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-4-6-sonnet\#strengths)

- More affordable than Opus while keeping strong coding abilities and thinking support. Good for everyday coding tasks.
- Supports extended reasoning for tasks that benefit from deeper analysis.
- Same provider and style as Opus at a lower price point.

## [Limitations](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-4-6-sonnet\#limitations)

- Codex and Composer offer more capability per dollar for most coding tasks.
- For peak quality, Opus remains the stronger choice.

## [Tools](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-4-6-sonnet\#tools)

Sonnet 4.6 has access to all agent tools when used with Cursor including:

## [Pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-4-6-sonnet\#pricing)

Cursor [plans](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing) include two usage pools. Sonnet 4.6 draws from the **API** pool, which charges at the rates below. Individual plans include at least $20 of API usage each month (more on higher tiers). All prices are per million tokens.

| Name | Input | Cache Write | Cache Read | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Anthropic](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/providers/anthropic-dark.svg)![Anthropic](https://cursor.com/docs-static/images/providers/anthropic-light.svg)<br>[Claude 4.6 Sonnet](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-4-6-sonnet) | $3 | $3.75 | $0.3 | $15 |

A thinking variant is available for deeper reasoning. When input exceeds 200k tokens (long context), pricing is 2x the standard rate.
