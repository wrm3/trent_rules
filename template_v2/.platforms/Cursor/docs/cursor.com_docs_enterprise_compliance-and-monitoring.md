# Compliance and Monitoring

Compliance requires visibility into who did what, when, and why. This documentation covers audit logs, AI code tracking, certifications, and how to meet regulatory requirements.

## [Audit logs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#audit-logs)

Audit logs provide a record of security events and administrative actions. Available on the [Enterprise plan](https://cursor.com/contact-sales?source=docs-audit-logs), audit logs help you meet compliance requirements and investigate security incidents.

We log the following events:

- **Authentication events:** Logins and logouts
- **User management:** User additions (via SSO, invite, signup, team creation, or auto-enrollment), removals, role changes, and individual spend limits
- **API key management:** Team and user API key creation and revocation
- **Team settings:** Team-wide and per-user spending limits, admin settings, team name changes, Slack integration settings, and repository mappings
- **Repository management:** Repository creation, deletion, and settings updates
- **Directory groups:** Directory group creation, updates, deletion, membership changes, and permission modifications
- **Privacy settings:** Privacy Mode changes at user or team level
- **Team rules:** Team rule management (including Bugbot rules) for custom workflows
- **Team commands:** Custom command creation, updates, and deletion

We do not log agent responses or generated code content.

Instead, we recommend using [hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks) to log prompts and code.

### [Accessing audit logs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#accessing-audit-logs)

View audit logs in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=audit-log). This is available on Enterprise plans, and requires admin access.

### [Streaming audit logs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#streaming-audit-logs)

For compliance and security monitoring, stream audit logs to your existing systems:

- SIEM systems (Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog, etc.)
- Webhook endpoints for custom processing
- S3 buckets for long-term retention
- Log aggregators like Elasticsearch or CloudWatch

Please contact [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) if you would like to receive streaming audit logs.

### [Log format](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#log-format)

Audit logs are delivered as JSON and include metadata and event-specific fields:

```
{
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-10-14T18:30:45Z",
    "event_id": "evt_abc123xyz789"
  },
  "team_id": "team_xyz789",
  "ip_address": "203.0.113.42",
  "user_email": "alice@company.com",
  "event": { /* event-specific fields */ }
}
```

The event types include:

- `login` \- User login events (web or app)
- `logout` \- User logout events
- `add_user` \- User additions (with source: `sso`, `invite`, `signup`, `createTeam`, or `autoEnroll`)
- `remove_user` \- User removals from team
- `update_user_role` \- Role changes (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER)
- `user_spend_limit` \- Individual user spending limit changes
- `team_api_key` \- Team API key actions (create, revoke)
- `user_api_key` \- User API key actions (create, revoke)
- `team_settings` \- Team setting modifications, including:
- `team_hard_limit_dollars` \- Team-wide spending hard limit
- `team_hard_limit_per_user_dollars` \- Per-user hard limit
- `per_user_monthly_limit_dollars` \- Monthly spending limits per user
- `admin_only_usage_pricing` \- Admin-only usage pricing settings
- `team_admin_settings` \- General admin settings
- `team_name` \- Team name changes
- `slack_default_repo` \- Slack integration repository settings
- `slack_default_branch` \- Slack integration branch settings
- `slack_default_model` \- Slack integration model settings
- `slack_share_summary` \- Slack summary sharing settings
- `slack_share_summary_in_external_channel` \- External channel sharing
- `slack_channel_repo_mappings` \- Slack channel to repository mappings
- `team_repo` \- Repository actions (create, delete, update\_settings)
- `create_directory_group` \- Directory group creation
- `update_directory_group` \- Directory group updates
- `update_directory_group_permissions` \- Directory group permission changes
- `delete_directory_group` \- Directory group deletion
- `add_user_to_directory_group` \- Adding users to directory groups
- `remove_user_from_directory_group` \- Removing users from directory groups
- `privacy_mode` \- Privacy Mode changes (scope: "user" or "team")
- `team_rule` \- Team rule management (create, update, delete)
- `bugbot_team_rule` \- Bugbot-specific rule management (create, update, delete)

### [Searching and filtering](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#searching-and-filtering)

Filter audit logs in the dashboard by:

- Date range
- Event type (authentication, user management, settings)
- Actor (specific user)

Export filtered results to CSV for analysis or compliance reports.

## [Using hooks for compliance logging](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#using-hooks-for-compliance-logging)

Audit logs track administrative actions, but some compliance requirements need logging of development activity. Use hooks to log:

### [Prompts submitted hook](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#prompts-submitted-hook)

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
prompt=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.prompt')
user_id=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.user_id')

# Log to your compliance system
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"prompt\",\"user\":\"$user_id\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

cat << EOF
{
  "continue": true
}
EOF
```

### [Code generated hook](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring\#code-generated-hook)

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.file_path')
edits=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.edits')

# Log the code generation event (not the actual code)
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"generation\",\"file\":\"$file_path\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

exit 0
```

**Important:** Be careful logging actual code or prompts. They may contain sensitive information. Log metadata (who, when, what file) rather than content when possible.

See [Hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks) for hook implementation details.
