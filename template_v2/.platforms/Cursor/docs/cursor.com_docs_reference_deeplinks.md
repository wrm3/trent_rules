# Deeplinks

Deeplinks allow you to share prompts, commands, and rules with others, enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams and communities.

Links can also be opened via [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/). Append the path and url params to the end of the url, for example: [cursor.com/link/prompt?text=...](https://cursor.com/link/prompt?text=Research+and+find+one+bug+in+this+codebase)

Always review your prompts and commands before sharing to ensure they don't contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or proprietary code.

## [Prompts](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/deeplinks\#prompts)

Share prompts that others can use to get started quickly with specific tasks or workflows. When someone clicks a prompt deeplink, it opens Cursor with the prompt pre-filled in the chat. The user must review and confirm the prompt before it gets executed. Deeplinks never trigger automatic execution.

Research and find one bug in this codebase

## [Commands](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/deeplinks\#commands)

Share commands that others can execute directly in their Cursor environment. Command deeplinks allow you to share custom commands defined in your `.cursor/commands` directory. When someone clicks a command deeplink, it opens Cursor and creates a new command with the specified name and content. The user must review and confirm the command before it gets executed.

## [Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/deeplinks\#rules)

Share rules that others can add to their Cursor environment. Rule deeplinks allow you to share custom rules defined in your `.cursor/rules` directory. When someone clicks a rule deeplink, it opens Cursor and creates a new rule with the specified name and content. The user must review and confirm the rule before it gets added.

typescript-strict: Always use strict TypeScript types and avoid 'any'

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/deeplinks\#faq)

### What is the maximum length for deeplink URLs?

Deeplink URLs have a maximum length of 8,000 characters. When generating deeplinks programmatically, ensure your content doesn't exceed this limit when URL-encoded. The interactive generators above will show you the current URL length and remaining characters as you type.

### How do I use deeplinks on the web instead of in the Cursor app?

You can swap the deeplink protocol for web links by changing the base URL from `cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/` to `https://cursor.com/link/`. For example:

```
cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/prompt?text=Hello%20world
```

```
https://cursor.com/link/prompt?text=Hello%20world
```

Web links will redirect users to cursor.com where they can open the deeplink in their browser or copy it to use in Cursor.
