CLI

# Using Agent in CLI

## [Modes](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#modes)

The CLI supports the same [modes](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/overview) as the editor. Switch modes using slash commands or the `--mode` flag.

### [Plan mode](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#plan-mode)

Use Plan mode to design your approach before coding. The agent asks clarifying questions to refine your plan.

- Press `Shift+Tab` to rotate to Plan mode
- Use `/plan` to switch to Plan mode
- Start with `--plan` or `--mode=plan` flag

### [Ask mode](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#ask-mode)

Use Ask mode to explore code without making changes. The agent searches your codebase and provides answers without editing files.

- Use `/ask` to switch to Ask mode
- Start with `--mode=ask` flag

## [Prompting](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#prompting)

Stating intent clearly is recommended for the best results. For example, you can use the prompt "do not write any code" to ensure that the agent won't edit any files. This is generally helpful when planning tasks before implementing them.

Agent has tools for file operations, searching, running shell commands, and web access.

## [MCP](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#mcp)

Agent supports [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp/directory) for extended functionality and integrations. The CLI will automatically detect and respect your `mcp.json` configuration file, enabling the same MCP servers and tools that you've configured for the editor.

## [ACP](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#acp)

Agent also supports [ACP (Agent Client Protocol)](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/acp) for custom client integrations. Use `agent acp` to run Cursor CLI as an ACP server over `stdio` with JSON-RPC messaging.

## [Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#rules)

The CLI agent supports the same [rules system](https://cursor.com/docs/rules) as the editor. You can create rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory to provide context and guidance to the agent. These rules will be automatically loaded and applied based on their configuration, allowing you to customize the agent's behavior for different parts of your project or specific file types.

The CLI also reads `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the project root (if
present) and applies them as rules alongside `.cursor/rules`.

## [Working with Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#working-with-agent)

### [Navigation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#navigation)

Previous messages can be accessed using arrow up ( `ArrowUpArrow Up`) where you can cycle through them.

### [Input shortcuts](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#input-shortcuts)

- `Shift+Tab` — Rotate between modes (Agent, Plan, Ask)
- `Shift+Enter` — Insert a newline instead of submitting, making it easier to write multi-line prompts.
- `Ctrl+D` — Exit the CLI. Follows standard shell behavior, requiring a double-press to exit.
- `Ctrl+J` or `+Enter` — Universal alternatives for inserting newlines that work in all terminals.

`Shift+Enter` works in iTerm2, Ghostty, Kitty, Warp, and Zed. For tmux users, use `Ctrl+J` instead. See [Terminal Setup](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/terminal-setup) for configuration options and troubleshooting.

### [Review](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#review)

Review changes with `Ctrl+R`. Press `i` to add follow-up instructions. Use `ArrowUpArrow Up`/ `ArrowDownArrow Down` to scroll, and `ArrowLeftArrow Left`/ `ArrowRightArrow Right` to switch files.

### [Selecting context](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#selecting-context)

Select files and folders to include in context with `@`. Free up space in the context window by running `/compress`.

## [Cloud Agent handoff](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#cloud-agent-handoff)

Push your conversation to a [Cloud Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent) and let it keep running while you're away. Start a session in cloud mode with `-c` / `--cloud`, or prepend `&` to any message to send it to the cloud. Pick it back up on web or mobile at [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents).

```
# Start in cloud mode
agent -c "refactor the auth module and add comprehensive tests"

# Send a task to Cloud Agent mid-conversation
& refactor the auth module and add comprehensive tests
```

## [History](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#history)

Continue from an existing thread with `--resume [thread id]` to load prior context.

To resume the most recent conversation, use `agent resume`, `--continue`, or the `/resume` slash command.

You can also run `agent ls` to see a list of previous conversations.

## [Command approval](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#command-approval)

Before running terminal commands, CLI will ask you to approve ( `y`) or reject ( `n`) execution.

## [Non-interactive mode](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/using\#non-interactive-mode)

Use `-p` or `--print` to run Agent in non-interactive mode. This will print the response to the console.

With non-interactive mode, you can invoke Agent in a non-interactive way. This allows you to integrate it in scripts, CI pipelines, etc.

You can combine this with `--output-format` to control how the output is formatted. For example, use `--output-format json` for structured output that's easier to parse in scripts, or `--output-format text` for plain text output of the agent's final response.

Cursor has full write access in non-interactive mode.
