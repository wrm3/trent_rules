Agent

# Semantic & agentic search

Agent combines multiple search tools to find relevant code across your codebase. You describe what you're looking for in natural language, and Agent picks the right strategy.

## [Instant Grep](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#instant-grep)

The fastest way to find code is an exact match: a function name, variable, error string, or regex pattern. Agent uses grep automatically when you reference specific symbols.

Cursor ships with [Instant Grep](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-1#instant-grep-beta), a custom search engine that outperforms `ripgrep` on large codebases. It runs automatically; no configuration needed.

Instant Grep supports full regex and word-boundary matching, so Agent can construct patterns like `import.*PaymentService` or `PaymentFailedError` to trace references across files.

## [Semantic search](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#semantic-search)

When you don't know the exact name, semantic search finds code by meaning. Ask "where do we handle authentication?" and Agent can locate `middleware/session.ts` even though the word "authentication" never appears in the file.

This works because Cursor [indexes your codebase](https://cursor.com/blog/secure-codebase-indexing) into searchable vectors with a custom embedding model. Research on Cursor's [semantic search](https://cursor.com/blog/semsearch) shows that combining it with grep produces 12.5% higher accuracy answering codebase questions compared to grep alone. The improvement is largest on codebases with 1,000+ files.

### [How indexing works](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#how-indexing-works)

Cursor breaks your code into meaningful chunks (functions, classes, logical blocks), converts each chunk into a vector embedding that captures its semantic meaning, and stores the results in a vector database. When you search, your query is converted into a vector using the same model and matched against the stored embeddings.

Indexing begins automatically when you open a workspace. Semantic search becomes available at 80% completion. The index stays current through automatic sync every 5 minutes, processing only changed files.

| Change | Action |
| --- | --- |
| New files | Added to the index automatically |
| Modified files | Old embeddings removed, new ones created |
| Deleted files | Removed from the index |

### [Configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#configuration)

Check indexing status or trigger a re-index from **Cursor Settings > Indexing**.

Cursor indexes all files except those in [ignore files](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/ignore-file) (`.gitignore`, `.cursorignore`). Ignoring large generated or content files improves search accuracy.

To view indexed file paths: **Cursor Settings > Indexing & Docs > View included files**.

### [Privacy and security](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#privacy-and-security)

File paths are encrypted before being sent to Cursor's servers. Code content is never stored in plaintext; it is held in memory during indexing, then discarded. Embeddings are created without storing filenames or source code. When Agent searches, Cursor retrieves the embeddings and decrypts the chunks on the client side.

## [How Agent combines search tools](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#how-agent-combines-search-tools)

Agent picks the right tool based on your prompt:

| Prompt style | Tools used | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specific symbol or string | Grep | "Find all files that import `PaymentService`" |
| Concept or behavior | Semantic search, then grep to fill in details | "How does our app handle failed payments?" |
| Complex exploration | Multiple searches, file reads, reference following | "Map the data flow from checkout to confirmation email" |

You don't choose the tool. Describe what you need and Agent decides. For complex tasks, it chains searches together: semantic search to find entry points, grep to trace references, and file reads to build full context.

## [Explore subagent](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#explore-subagent)

Agent can spawn an [Explore subagent](https://cursor.com/docs/subagents) that runs in its own context window with a faster model. It executes many parallel searches without bloating the main conversation, returning only the relevant findings.

Agent uses the Explore subagent automatically when it decides a task benefits from broad search. You can also request it directly: "use a subagent to find all the places we validate user input."

This is useful for context management. Searching through many files generates a lot of context. The subagent keeps the main conversation focused by summarizing results instead of dumping raw file contents.

## [Tips for better search results](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#tips-for-better-search-results)

- **Start specific, then go broad.** If you know the function name, say it. If you're exploring unfamiliar code, describe the behavior.
- **Explore before changing.** Ask Agent to show existing patterns before asking it to add new ones. This prevents it from creating duplicates or breaking conventions.
- **Reference concrete code.** Prompts like "find all callers of `processOrder`" give Agent an exact target. Prompts like "find the order code" force Agent to guess what you mean.

## [FAQ](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/search\#faq)

### Is my source code stored on Cursor servers?

No. Cursor creates embeddings without storing filenames or source code. Filenames are obfuscated and code chunks are encrypted. When Agent searches, Cursor retrieves the embeddings and decrypts the chunks on the client side.

### How long are indexed codebases retained?

Indexed codebases are deleted after 6 weeks of inactivity. Reopening the project triggers re-indexing.

### Can I customize path encryption?

Create a `.cursor/keys` file in your workspace root:

```
{
  "path_decryption_key": "your-custom-key-here"
}
```

### How does team sharing work?

Indexes can be shared across team members for faster indexing of similar codebases. Cursor respects file access permissions and only shares accessible content.

### Does Cursor support multi-root workspaces?

Yes. Cursor supports [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces#_multiroot-workspaces). All codebases get indexed automatically, and each codebase's context is available to Agent. Some features that rely on a single git root, like worktrees, are disabled for multi-root workspaces. Cloud Agents do not support multi-root workspaces.
