# AI Code Tracking API

The AI Code Tracking API lets you track AI-generated code contributions across your team's repositories, including per-commit AI usage and granular accepted AI changes.

- The AI Code Tracking API uses [Basic Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/api#basic-authentication) with your API key as the username, the same method as the Admin API.
- For details on creating API keys, authentication methods, rate limits, and best practices, see the [API Overview](https://cursor.com/docs/api).
- **Availability**: Enterprise only, [contact sales](https://cursor.com/contact-sales?source=docs-ai-code-tracking) to get access
- **Status**: Alpha (response shapes and fields may change)
- **Workspace limitation**: Metrics are only calculated for the git repository at the top level of the workspace root. Multi-root workspaces are not currently supported.

## [Endpoints](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#endpoints)

## [Common Query Parameters](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#common-query-parameters)

All endpoints accept the same query parameters via query string:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `startDate` | string \| date | No | ISO date string, the literal "now", or relative days like "7d" (means now - 7 days). Default: now - 7 days |
| `endDate` | string \| date | No | ISO date string, the literal "now", or relative days like "0d". Default: now |
| `page` | number | No | Page number (1-based). Default: 1 |
| `pageSize` | number | No | Results per page. Default: 100, Max: 1000 |
| `user` | string | No | Optional filter by a single user. Accepts email (e.g., [developer@company.com](mailto:developer@company.com)), encoded ID (e.g., user\_abc123...), or numeric ID (e.g., 42) |

Responses return userId as an encoded external ID with the prefix user\_. This
is stable for API consumption.

## [Semantics and How Metrics Are Computed](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#semantics-and-how-metrics-are-computed)

- **Sources**: "TAB" represents inline completions that were accepted; "COMPOSER" represents accepted diffs from Agent edits
- **Lines metrics**: tabLinesAdded/Deleted and composerLinesAdded/Deleted are separately counted; nonAiLinesAdded/Deleted are derived as max(0, totalLines - AI lines)
- **Privacy mode**: If enabled in the client, some metadata (like fileName) may be omitted
- **Branch info**: isPrimaryBranch is true when the current branch equals the repo's default branch; may be undefined if repo info is unavailable

You can scan that file to understand how commits and changes are detected and reported.

## [Tips](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#tips)

- Use `user` parameter to quickly filter a single user across all endpoints
- For large data extractions, prefer CSV endpoints—they stream in pages of 10,000 records server-side
- `isPrimaryBranch` may be undefined if the client couldn't resolve the default branch
- `commitTs` is the commit timestamp; `createdAt` is the ingestion time on our servers
- Some fields may be absent when privacy mode is enabled on the client
- Commit hashes are not unique or unchangeable. For example, you may see the same commit twice if you amend commits with extra information.
- Commit timestamps will remain unchanged even if the commit is amended.

## [Changelog](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api\#changelog)

- **Alpha release**: Initial endpoints for commits and changes. Response shapes may evolve based on feedback
