Pitch Deck Review: AcmeAnalytics Seed Deck

Overall: 7.5/10 - Strong foundation, needs refinement

Strengths:
✓ Clear problem statement with quantified pain
✓ Impressive traction ($840k ARR, 22% MoM growth)
✓ Strong team with relevant experience
✓ Differentiated AI approach

Areas for Improvement:

Slide 4 (Market Size):
- TAM calculation is top-down only
- Add bottom-up validation (target customers × ACV)
- SOM of 5% seems aggressive without proof
→ Recommendation: Show both top-down and bottom-up, reduce SOM to 2-3%

Slide 7 (Traction):
- Missing net retention rate (key for SaaS)
- Customer logos are small and hard to read
- Growth chart doesn't show clear hockey stick
→ Recommendation: Add NRR metric, enlarge logos, extend chart timeline

Slide 9 (Competitive Advantage):
- Moat is primarily team and technology
- No clear network effects or data flywheel yet
→ Recommendation: Emphasize data accumulation strategy, show path to network effects

Slide 12 (Financials):
- Projections show 10x growth YoY (too aggressive)
- Missing key assumptions (churn, ACV growth, etc.)
→ Recommendation: Reduce growth to 3-4x YoY, add assumptions slide to appendix

Next Steps:
1. Revise slides 4, 7, 9, 12 based on feedback
2. Add appendix with detailed financials and assumptions
3. Practice pitch timing (currently 22 min, target 18 min)
4. Get feedback from 2-3 more advisors
5. Ready to start VC outreach in 1-2 weeks
```

2. Search VC databases (Crunchbase, AngelList, internal database)
3. Analyze portfolio fit and investment thesis
4. Research partners and decision makers
5. Prioritize by tier (1-4) based on fit
6. Identify warm introduction paths

**Search Criteria**:

### 3. Term Sheet Analysis

2. Identify key terms (valuation, preferences, board, voting)
3. Highlight non-standard or concerning terms
4. Compare to market standards
5. Recommend negotiation priorities
6. Model dilution and founder outcomes

**Key Terms Analyzed**:
- Valuation (pre-money, post-money)
- Investment amount and structure
- Liquidation preference (1x, participating, seniority)
- Anti-dilution protection (broad-based, full ratchet)
- Board composition and voting rights
- Protective provisions (veto rights)
- Pro-rata rights and super pro-rata
- Drag-along and tag-along rights
- No-shop period and exclusivity
- Closing conditions

**Example Output**:
```
Term Sheet Analysis: $2M Seed Round from Accel

SUMMARY: 8/10 - Very founder-friendly with one concern

Key Terms:

✓ Valuation: $8M pre-money, $10M post-money (20% dilution)
   → Market standard for your traction ($840k ARR, 22% MoM growth)

✓ Investment: $2M Series Seed Preferred Stock
   → Standard structure

✓ Liquidation Preference: 1x non-participating
   → EXCELLENT - This is the gold standard (not participating)

✓ Anti-dilution: Broad-based weighted average
   → Market standard (not full ratchet)

⚠️  Board Composition: 2 founders, 1 investor, 1 independent (investor picks)
   → CONCERN: Investor picking independent board member
   → NEGOTIATE: Mutual agreement on independent director

✓ Protective Provisions: Standard (sale, new equity, debt, dividends)
   → Market standard, reasonable scope

⚠️  Pro-rata Rights: Lead gets 2x pro-rata (super pro-rata)
   → CONCERN: Super pro-rata can squeeze out other investors in future rounds
   → CONSIDER: Standard pro-rata (1x) is more founder-friendly

✓ Drag-Along: Standard with $20M minimum price
   → Reasonable floor price protection

⚠️  No-Shop: 45 days
   → CONCERN: 45 days is longer than standard (30 days)
   → NEGOTIATE: Reduce to 30 days

✓ Closing Conditions: Standard DD, legal docs, board approval
   → No unusual conditions

Dilution Analysis:
- Current: Founders 90%, Advisors 2%, Option pool 8%
- Post-investment: Founders 72%, Advisors 1.6%, Employees 6.4%, Accel 20%
- Founder dilution: 18% (from 90% to 72%)

Exit Scenarios ($8M pre, $2M investment, $10M post):

$50M exit:
- 1x non-participating: Accel takes 20% = $10M, Founders get $40M (80%)
- 1x participating: Accel gets $2M + 20% of $48M = $11.6M, Founders $38.4M

Recommendation: ACCEPT with 3 key negotiations

Priority 1 (Critical):
- Independent board member selection: Require mutual agreement, not investor unilateral

Priority 2 (Important):
- No-shop period: Reduce from 45 to 30 days
- Super pro-rata: Remove 2x, use standard 1x pro-rata

Priority 3 (Nice-to-have):
- Option pool: Consider post-money pool to reduce founder dilution

Talking Points:
1. "We love the partnership and terms overall. On the independent board member, we'd like mutual agreement to ensure good fit for everyone."

2. "45-day no-shop is longer than standard. Can we reduce to 30 days? We can move quickly on diligence."

3. "Super pro-rata (2x) is unusual. Standard 1x pro-rata rights would be more attractive to future investors."

Next Steps:
1. Schedule call with partner to discuss these 3 points
2. Consult with your lawyer on negotiation strategy
3. If terms are agreeable, move to due diligence
4. Target closing in 6-8 weeks
